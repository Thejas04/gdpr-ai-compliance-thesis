advanced_explanation,compliant,Compliant-27.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled? The cookie policy does provide an option for users to give their consent by clicking ""accept all"". However, it's unclear if the user's initial visit constitutes implicit consent or if they are required to actively click 'accept all'.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily? Users can withdraw their consent through the provided settings. However, there seems to be no immediate option for withdrawing consent upon landing on the site, which is a best practice under GDPR.
   - Are granular consent options provided? The policy does offer granular consent options within the settings, but the initial 'accept all' option doesn't allow users to selectively consent to certain types of cookies.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? Yes, third-party data sharing is mentioned and can be managed through the provided settings.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? Yes, cross-border data transfers are mentioned, but there should be more information about the adequate level of protection when transferring data to third countries outside the European Economic Area (especially USA).

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): The policy does not explicitly define the terms 'controller' and 'processor', so it is Non-Compliant with this requirement.
   - Article 7: Since users are given an option to give their consent, but the initial visit might be considered implicit consent, the policy is Partially Compliant with Article 7.

5. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR because it provides some transparency and options for managing cookies, but it could improve in areas such as explicit consent handling and providing adequate information about cross-border data transfers.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Clearly state that the initial visit is considered implicit consent, or require active acceptance of the 'accept all' option to constitute explicit consent.
   - Offer immediate options for users to withdraw their consent upon landing on the site.
   - Provide more detailed information about cross-border data transfers, including measures taken to ensure an adequate level of protection under data protection law when transferring data to third countries outside the European Economic Area (especially USA).
   - Explicitly define the terms 'controller' and 'processor' in the policy."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-1.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - Explicit consent is handled by requiring users to accept or decline cookies upon their first visit, and the ability to adjust consent at any time.
     - Users can withdraw consent easily by clicking ""Continue with Essential Cookies"" for essential cookies only, or by accessing the Cookie Settings in the website footer.
     - Granular consent options are provided, as users can choose which categories of cookies they want to accept or decline (Essential, Marketing, and Statistical).

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
    - Third-party data sharing is outlined for several third parties listed in the Cookie Settings section.
    - Cross-border data transfers are not explicitly addressed but may be implied as many of the third parties listed are based outside Germany or may transfer data internationally for their services.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
    - Article 4(11): The policy does not provide a clear definition of cookies and similar technologies, making it difficult for users to understand exactly what they are consenting to. [Non-Compliant]
    - Article 7: While the cookie policy informs users about data processing, the information provided is not concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible, as required by Article 7(1). Moreover, the policy does not provide a clear legal basis for the use of cookies. [Non-Compliant]

5. Final Justification: The cookie policy partially complies with GDPR due to explicit consent handling, granular options, and the ability to withdraw consent easily. However, it fails to meet the requirements in Article 4(11) and Article 7 regarding the definition of cookies, concise information, and legal basis for data processing.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
    - Define cookies and similar technologies within the policy according to GDPR guidelines.
    - Provide a clear legal basis for the use of cookies and ensure that the information provided is concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible.
    - Explicitly address cross-border data transfers in the policy if they are applicable.
    - If possible, offer a more detailed explanation of each cookie category and its purpose to help users make informed decisions about their consent preferences."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-10.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant
   - The cookie policy provides clear information about the use of cookies and offers an opt-in/opt-out mechanism, which is essential under GDPR. However, it lacks specific details about purposes for processing beyond general categories (e.g., analytics, marketing) and fails to provide comprehensive transparency on data sharing with third parties.

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled? The policy offers options to accept all processing or only functional cookies upon the user's first visit, but it does not clearly indicate that accepting essential cookies constitutes explicit consent. Additionally, users may need more guidance to understand the implications of their choices.
     - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can manage their preferences at any time using the provided Cookie Settings feature. However, clarity about the consequences of denying or modifying settings could be improved for user understanding and control.
     - Are granular consent options provided? The policy offers some level of granularity by allowing users to accept or deny specific categories (essential, functional, marketing). However, more detailed options within each category may help users make informed decisions about their data sharing preferences.

  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The policy mentions the use of third-party services under the Categories & Services section but does not provide specific details about the purposes, types, and recipients of the shared data. More transparency is needed to meet GDPR requirements for clear communication regarding data processing activities.
     - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? No, the policy does not address cross-border data transfers or whether adequate safeguards are in place to ensure compliance with GDPR provisions.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): The policy does not explicitly define ""cookie"" according to the GDPR definition, potentially leading to non-compliance unless it can be demonstrated that users understand the term in a similar context.
     - Article 7: While the policy offers an opt-in mechanism for cookies, it may not meet the requirements of Article 7(2) and (4), as the information provided about the purpose of processing and data recipients is not sufficiently detailed or explicit.

  5. Final Justification: The policy partially meets GDPR requirements by offering an opt-in/opt-out mechanism, but it lacks specificity in communicating purposes for data processing, detailing third-party data sharing practices, and addressing cross-border data transfers, which are critical elements under the regulation.

  6. Improvement Suggestions:
     - To improve compliance with GDPR requirements, the cookie policy should be revised to provide more detailed information about purposes for data processing, offer granular consent options, clearly outline third-party data sharing practices (including cross-border transfers), and define ""cookie"" in line with the GDPR definition. Additionally, user guidance on the implications of their choices and the ability to withdraw consent easily can be enhanced to improve user understanding and control over their data."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-11.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides multiple options for users to give their consent, including accepting all cookies, rejecting unnecessary cookies, or customizing their preferences. However, the information provided about the consequences of not giving consent (specifically, data transfers to the US) may be too vague and could potentially mislead users about the implications of their choice.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can access their cookie settings at any time via the Cookie Policy and revoke their consent.
   - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, users can customize their preferences for non-essential cookies.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The policy mentions that some cookies are used for personalized advertising and content delivery, which implies third-party data sharing. However, it does not provide clear information about the specific third parties involved or the purposes of the data sharing.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? Yes, the policy informs users that data may be processed in the USA if they consent to non-essential cookies. However, as mentioned earlier, the information provided is vague and could potentially mislead users about the implications of their choice.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant. The policy does not provide clear and comprehensive information about the identity and contact details of the data controller, as required by Article 4(11).
   - Article 7: Partially Compliant. While users are provided with multiple options for giving their consent, the information provided about the consequences of not giving consent is unclear and could potentially mislead users about the implications of their choice.

5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant due to issues with data transparency and lack of clarity in the information provided to users regarding the consequences of their choices.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance include providing clearer information about the specific third parties involved in data sharing, the purposes of the data sharing, and the implications of not giving consent, especially in relation to cross-border data transfers. The policy should also ensure compliance with Article 4(11) by clearly stating the identity and contact details of the data controller."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-12.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled? The policy allows users to explicitly consent by clicking ""Accept all"" or customizing their preferences. However, the ""Reject all"" option only allows essential cookies, which may not be compliant with GDPR requirements for granular consent.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can change their cookie preferences at any time through the ""Manage settings"" option.
   - Are granular consent options provided? The policy provides some level of granularity, allowing users to choose between functional and advertising cookies. However, it does not allow users to accept or reject each individual cookie.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? Yes, the policy mentions that advertising cookies are used by advertisers, implying third-party data sharing.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? The policy does not explicitly address cross-border data transfers. However, since cookies can be used to transfer data across borders, it should include a statement about this.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant + Reason: The policy does not provide the specific identity and contact details of the data controller or data protection officer as required by Article 4(11).
   - Article 7: Partially Compliant + Reason: While the policy provides a method for obtaining consent, it may not meet the GDPR requirement for providing information in an intelligible and easily accessible form. The explanation of different types of cookies could be more explicit.

5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with the GDPR as it allows users to give and withdraw their consent and provides some level of granularity. However, it lacks clarity on cross-border data transfers and fails to comply fully with Article 4(11) by not providing the identity and contact details of the data controller or data protection officer.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance include:
     - Providing a clear and concise explanation of each type of cookie used, including third-party cookies.
     - Explicitly stating any cross-border data transfers and their implications.
     - Including the identity and contact details of the data controller or data protection officer as required by Article 4(11).
     - Allowing users to accept or reject individual cookies for greater granularity in consent options."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-13.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - Explicit consent is handled through the given options to accept or decline cookies. However, it should be noted that user consent for analytics and marketing purposes requires an affirmative action (clicking 'Accept All'), which may not meet the GDPR standard for a clear and affirmative action.
   - Users can withdraw their consent by changing their cookie settings at any time. This mechanism is compliant with GDPR requirements.
   - Granular consent options are provided, allowing users to customize their preferences.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Third-party data sharing is clearly outlined in the policy, stating that partners also use cookies and user profiles may be created across websites and devices for this purpose.
   - Cross-border data transfers are addressed, acknowledging that data may be transferred outside the EU where data protection cannot be guaranteed under Article 49 (1) a GDPR.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): [Partially Compliant] – The policy provides information on what cookies are, their purpose, and how they function; however, it does not specify the exact technical storage or access that is undertaken.
   - Article 7: [Non-Compliant] – The default setting for analytics, marketing, and third-party marketing through partners is 'OFF' but requires user consent to activate them. Under GDPR, pre-ticked boxes or settings set to 'on' without explicit user consent are not considered compliant.

5. Final Justification:
   - The policy is partially compliant due to the lack of meeting Article 7 requirements for default cookie settings and some information missing under Article 4(11). However, it does provide a clear mechanism for users to withdraw or modify their consent.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To meet GDPR compliance standards, change the default setting for analytics, marketing, and third-party marketing through partners from 'OFF' to 'Declined.' This ensures that users must actively give their explicit consent before these cookies are activated.
   - Provide additional information about technical storage or access in the policy under Article 4(11) to offer more transparency."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-14.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides users with the option to accept or reject all cookies, and allows granular control over certain categories of cookies. However, necessary cookies are always active which could potentially infringe on user's choices and lead to implicit consent.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can revoke their consent at any time by adjusting settings in the cookie preferences.
   - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, users have the ability to manage their consent for various categories of cookies, including analysis, marketing & social networks, and personal offers.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? Yes, the policy provides information about data sharing with partners and social networks for advertising purposes. However, more specific details about these partners could be included to increase transparency.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? The policy does not explicitly mention cross-border data transfers, so it's unclear whether they are addressed in the Privacy Policy or not.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant (Necessary cookies are always active without explicit consent, which goes against the definition of necessary cookies under GDPR)
   - Article 7: Partially Compliant (The policy provides means for users to give and withdraw consent, but it could be improved by ensuring that all cookies require explicit consent)

5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it allows users to manage their consent and provides information about data sharing with partners. However, the use of necessary cookies without explicit consent may cause non-compliance with GDPR Article 4(11).

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Ensure that all cookies require explicit consent in order to fully comply with GDPR Article 7 and Article 4(11)
   - Provide more specific details about third-party partners involved in data sharing for increased transparency
   - Explicitly address cross-border data transfers in the cookie policy or link to relevant information in the Privacy Policy."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-15.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides an option for users to accept or reject all cookies, but it does not require explicit consent for each category of cookie (e.g., performance, functional, targeting). This could be improved to meet the GDPR's granular consent requirements.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can withdraw their consent at any time via ""Cookie Settings.""
   - Are granular consent options provided? No, users are only given the option to accept or reject all cookies, not individual ones.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The policy mentions that cookies may be used for personalized advertising and remarketing (targeting cookies), which implies third-party data sharing. However, it would be more transparent to explicitly state who the third parties are and what specific data is shared.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? There is no mention of cross-border data transfers in the policy. It should be made clear whether any data transfer takes place outside the EU.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant (The policy does not provide a comprehensive description of cookies, including but not limited to what purposes they serve beyond user experience enhancement).
   - Article 7: Partially Compliant (Users are given the choice to accept or reject cookies, but explicit consent is not required for each category of cookie as per GDPR requirements).

5. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR due to the lack of granularity in the consent mechanism and insufficient information regarding data sharing with third parties and cross-border data transfers.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance include providing granular consent options (explicit consent for each category of cookie), outlining specific third-party data sharing practices, addressing cross-border data transfers, and updating the policy to provide a more detailed description of cookies in line with GDPR Article 4(11)."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-16.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled? Users are given the option to provide explicit consent by choosing either ""Reject non-essential cookies"" or ""Accept all cookies"". The ""Accept all cookies"" option grants full consent, while the other two options require users to opt-in.
     - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can change their cookie preferences at any time through the ""Cookie Settings"" option.
     - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, users are given granular control over which types of cookies they allow (technically necessary, statistics/range measurement, marketing).

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? Yes, the policy provides information about third-party data sharing for statistics/range measurement and marketing purposes.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? Yes, the policy mentions that data may be accessed from multiple countries including EU, USA, India, and UK for maintenance purposes.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): The policy does not explicitly define ""personal data"" or ""processing"", however, it is implied as the cookies collect user's preferences which may be considered personal data. Therefore, this section can be marked as Non-Compliant. (Reason: Lack of explicit definitions)
   - Article 7: The cookie policy provides users with clear and concise information about the processing of their data and offers them choices regarding that processing. However, it does not specify the manner in which consent is requested, which may be considered unclear or non-specific. Therefore, this section can be marked as Partially Compliant. (Reason: Lack of specificity in requesting consent)

5. Final Justification: The cookie policy is partially compliant with GDPR due to the lack of explicit definitions of personal data and processing as required by Article 4(11), and because the manner in which consent is requested does not fully meet the requirements of Article 7.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To improve compliance, explicitly define ""personal data"" and ""processing"" as per GDPR guidelines within the cookie policy.
   - Clearly outline the specific method used to request user's consent in accordance with Article 7 of the GDPR. This could include specifying when, how, and where users are prompted to give their consent."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-17.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled? The policy allows users to provide explicit consent by accepting or customizing their preferences, but it is not clearly stated if the first visit implies acceptance of all cookies.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can adjust their cookie settings at any time.
   - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, users are provided with three options to choose from based on their preference: ""Accept Cookies"" (granting full consent), ""Accept Only Necessary"", and ""Cookie Settings"".

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The policy mentions targeting cookies that track interests and browsing behavior for targeted advertising, which implies data may be shared with third parties; however, it is not explicitly stated who these third parties are.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? No, there is no mention of cross-border data transfers in the provided policy text.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): The policy does provide definitions for cookies and other related terms but does not explicitly state how they conform to the definition provided in Article 4(11) of the GDPR. [Non-Compliant]
   - Article 7: The policy offers clear information about the use of cookies, but it is not explicit whether consent is given through a clear affirmative action or if the user's continued navigation on the website implies consent. As mentioned earlier, the first visit to the site could be interpreted as implicit consent for all cookies. [Partially Compliant]

5. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements due to the lack of clarity in Article 4(11) and Article 7 compliance, along with the absence of details on cross-border data transfers and third-party data sharing.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Make it clear that continuing to navigate the site implies consent only for necessary cookies (not all cookies), and provide a simple and prominent way to accept or refuse all cookies based on explicit user choice.
   - Clearly outline who third-party entities are that may receive data through targeted advertising.
   - Explicitly address cross-border data transfers, if applicable, and ensure compliance with GDPR requirements for such transfers.
   - Clarify the definitions provided in Article 4(11) of the GDPR to demonstrate compliance with these definitions."

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides users with the option to accept all cookies or only essential cookies, which could be considered as explicit consent for the respective data processing activities. However, granular consent options are not provided for all types of cookies, such as performance and marketing cookies, where users may need to click on ""Settings"" to customize their preferences.
     - Can users withdraw consent easily? Users can revoke their consent at any time by deleting cookies or adjusting their cookie settings. However, it is unclear whether the withdrawal of consent will prevent the retrospective processing of data collected before the withdrawal.
     - Are granular consent options provided? While some granular consent options are available (performance and marketing cookies), users must click on ""Settings"" to view and customize their preferences. This could be improved by offering more prominent, user-friendly options for managing cookie settings.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? Yes, the policy mentions that collected data will be shared with selected partners such as Google.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? No, cross-border data transfers are not explicitly mentioned in the policy. However, it is reasonable to assume that, as a multinational corporation, Mercedes-Benz may transfer data across borders, necessitating compliance with GDPR requirements for international data transfers.
4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant + Reason: The policy does not provide a clear and accessible definition of cookies or similar technologies. As such, users may not fully understand the types of data that are being collected and processed.
   - Article 7: Compliant + Reason: The policy provides clear information about the purposes for which personal data is processed and offers users multiple options to manage their cookie settings, thus meeting the requirements for explicit and informed consent under Article 7.
5. Final Justification: Partially compliant as it lacks some granularity in the consent mechanism, does not explicitly address cross-border data transfers, and could be improved in providing a clear definition of cookies in the policy.
6. Improvement Suggestions:

      - Granular consent options are provided, allowing users to select specific categories of cookies they accept.
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
      - Third-party data sharing is outlined, stating that marketing cookies may share user data with third-party partners for advertising purposes.
      - Cross-border data transfers are addressed as the consent applies to multiple domains (including different regions), but there's no explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure GDPR compliance in these transfers.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
      - Article 4(11): The cookie policy does not provide a clear definition of 'personal data'. [Non-Compliant]
      - Article 7: The cookie policy clearly informs users about the processing of their data and provides a means to give and withdraw consent, although more clarity could be provided on how this impacts ongoing processing. [Partially Compliant]

   - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, users have the option to accept all cookies, reject everything, or choose specific categories of cookies. However, it's not clear if these settings apply across all Amazon services or just this specific service.
3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? Yes, the policy clearly states that 96 third-party providers use cookies for displaying and measuring personalized advertising, gaining audience insights, and developing and improving products.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? The policy does not explicitly address cross-border data transfers. However, Amazon is a multinational company, so it's likely that data may be transferred across borders.
4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): [Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy does not provide a clear and accessible explanation of cookies or similar technologies, which is required by Article 4(11).
   - Article 7: [Partially Compliant + Reason] While the policy provides a means to obtain and withdraw consent, it doesn't explicitly state that consent is necessary for the use of cookies. It also lacks information about the purpose of processing and the retention period of data collected through cookies.

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled? The cookie policy provides different options for users to give or withdraw their consent, which can be considered as an explicit form of consent. However, it's not clear if the ""Accept Everything"" option grants explicit consent for all data processing purposes, or if users are only giving implicit consent by clicking this button.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can change or revoke their consent at any time via the cookie settings link.
   - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, users have the option to configure individual preferences under the ""More"" tab, which provides a certain level of granularity.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? Yes, Dräger lists its third-party services using cookies, providing transparency about their data processing activities.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? The policy does not explicitly mention how it handles cross-border data transfers. As a company operating internationally, it is crucial to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place for such transfers.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy correctly explains the definitions of cookies and personal data, as per Article 4(11).
   - Article 7: [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] While users have the opportunity to give or withdraw consent, it's not clear if they are providing explicit consent for all data processing purposes. The ""Accept Everything"" option might be interpreted as implicit consent, which is not compliant with Article 7.

5. Final Justification: The policy lacks clarity in obtaining explicit consent from users for all data processing purposes, which makes it only partially compliant with the GDPR.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance:
     a) Clearly define the scope of ""Accept Everything"" option to ensure that users are giving explicit consent for each data processing purpose.
     b) Provide more information about cross-border data transfers and the measures in place to safeguard such transfers.
     c) Consider revising the language used in the policy to make it clearer and easier to understand for all users."

       - Non-Compliant: While the policy does provide information about the processing of personal data, explicit and granular consent for non-essential cookies is not provided as required by GDPR.

  5. Final Justification:
     - The main reason for a partially compliant rating is that while the cookie policy provides information about the use of cookies and user's data protection rights, it does not comply with GDPR requirements for providing explicit, granular consent options for non-essential cookies.

  6. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance include:
       - Providing separate and explicit consent options for each category of cookie (essential, functional, marketing & advertising, advanced features).
       - Ensuring that the non-essential cookies are only activated when users provide explicit consent.
       - Reviewing and updating the policy to ensure it complies with all GDPR requirements."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-22.docx,mistral:latest," In this text, the author discusses cookies and their use in websites. Cookies are small text files that store internet settings, and almost every website uses them. They help provide a better and faster online experience by tailoring content to users' personal needs and interests.

The text goes on to explain the difference between first-party and third-party cookies:
- First-party cookies are those placed on the website by the website owner or contracted service providers with which the user interacts.
- Third-party cookies may be placed during a visit to a website that contains content from other providers (third-party providers). These providers may use their own cookies, and users can reject them at any time using the corresponding function on the website.

The text also informs the reader about managing cookie settings via the features on the website or through changing browser settings. The reader is advised that when they change their cookie settings, certain cookies will be blocked, which may affect some features on the website.

Additionally, the text discusses where the information collected by cookies is processed: primarily within the extended European Union (EU) but in some cases in countries outside the EU, such as the US, where there is a risk that local authorities may obtain access to the data for monitoring purposes. The author reassures the reader that they have implemented additional security measures to ensure appropriate protection of the information collected by cookies.

Finally, the text ends with options for the reader to accept or reject cookies:
- ""Accept selected"": This option allows the user to select which categories of cookies they want to accept (e.g. necessary, preference, statistics, marketing) and reject others.
- ""Reject"": This option allows the user to reject all cookies that require their consent.
- ""Accept all"": This option allows the user to accept all cookies, including those that require their consent.

It's important to note that revoking cookie consent won't result in less advertising, but rather means that the displayed advertising isn't tailored to the user's personal needs. The text also provides a list of integrated third-party data processing (e.g. tags, scripts, pixels) for the reader's reference."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-23.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant
   - The cookie policy provides information about the types of cookies used and explains how they are related to marketing, analytics, and personalization. However, it lacks specific details on certain essential elements such as the retention period for cookies or the exact purpose for each type of cookie.

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled?
       - Explicit consent is handled through the Cookie Manager where users can choose their preferences and revoke them at any time. The policy provides a link to the privacy policy where more information can be found about cookies.

     - Can users withdraw consent easily?
       - Yes, users can withdraw their consent easily by accessing the Cookie Manager at any time.

     - Are granular consent options provided?
       - Yes, granular options are provided as users can choose which categories of cookies they accept or reject.

  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined?
       - Yes, the policy mentions that marketing cookies may be shared with other websites or third-party pages, such as Volkswagen Group companies or advertisers, for displaying personalized advertising. However, it would be more transparent to specify exact parties involved in this process.

     - Are cross-border data transfers addressed?
       - The policy does not explicitly mention cross-border data transfers; therefore, it is unclear if appropriate safeguards are in place for such transfers.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
       - Compliant - The policy defines cookies as 'personal data' according to Article 4(11) since they can identify a natural person.

     - Article 7: [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
       - Partially Compliant - While the policy provides an option for users to give and withdraw their consent, it lacks explicit information about the purpose of each type of cookie, which is required by Article 7(4).

  5. Final Justification:
     - The classification as Partially Compliant results from the lack of clarity on specific elements such as retention periods for cookies and the exact purpose for each type of cookie, as well as the unclear handling of cross-border data transfers.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance include providing detailed information about the purpose of each type of cookie, specifying parties involved in third-party data sharing, explicitly addressing cross-border data transfers, and outlining retention periods for cookies. It would also be beneficial to make the policy more user-friendly by simplifying language and ensuring that essential information is readily accessible."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-24.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides options for users to give and withdraw consent for different types of cookies, which can be considered as explicit consent. However, the default setting seems to allow all cookies unless explicitly changed by the user, which may not meet GDPR's requirement for active opt-in.
     - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can change their cookie preferences at any time through the Privacy Preference Center.
     - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, the policy offers separate options for different types of cookies (Strictly Necessary, Performance, Functional, Social Media, Personalization).

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? Yes, the policy mentions that functional cookies may be set by third-party providers and social media cookies are set by a range of social media services. However, it does not provide information about third parties with whom personal data may be shared beyond these instances.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? No, the policy does not mention whether or how cross-border data transfers occur, which should be made clear under GDPR requirements.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy provides definitions of cookies and their functions (Strictly Necessary, Performance, Functional, Social Media, Personalization), which aligns with the definition given in Article 4(11).
   - Article 7: [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy offers users the ability to give and withdraw consent for different types of cookies, but it may not meet GDPR's requirement for active opt-in as the default setting allows all cookies unless changed by the user.

5. Final Justification: Partially compliant because while the policy provides options for users to give and withdraw consent for different types of cookies, the default setting allowing all cookies unless explicitly changed may not meet GDPR's requirement for active opt-in. Additionally, there is no clear explanation about third-party data sharing or cross-border data transfers.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance could include:
     - Changing the default setting to not allow cookies unless explicitly consented to by the user.
     - Providing a clear explanation about third-party data sharing, including any cross-border data transfers that may occur and how they are safeguarded under GDPR.
     - Adding more details about the purpose and storage duration of each type of cookie in the policy for greater transparency."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-25.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides a mechanism for users to give their explicit consent by allowing them to accept or reject cookies, but it does not clearly state that the use of necessary cookies does not require user consent as per GDPR (as it is considered necessary for the website's functionality).
     - Can users withdraw consent easily? Users can easily manage and modify their cookie preferences at any time using the buttons provided in the cookie banner. However, the policy should clarify how long the cookies will be stored after being withdrawn by the user.
     - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, the policy offers granular options to users, enabling them to accept or reject specific types of cookies (e.g., necessary, statistic).

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? Yes, the policy outlines third-party cookies used on the website, their lifespan, and their providers (e.g., etracker.com, Cloudflare).
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? The policy does not explicitly mention cross-border data transfers; however, as the website uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) and etracker services, it is assumed that cross-border data transfers may occur. It would be beneficial to clarify this point in the policy.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy mentions cookies clearly, so it can be considered compliant with Article 4(11).
   - Article 7: [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy provides a clear and easily accessible method for users to give and withdraw their consent regarding the use of cookies. However, as previously mentioned, the policy does not explicitly state that necessary cookies do not require user consent. It would be better to clarify this point in the policy to ensure compliance with Article 7.

5. Final Justification: The main reason for classifying the cookie policy as Partially Compliant is that although it provides a mechanism for users to give and withdraw their consent regarding cookies, there is room for improvement in explaining necessary cookies and cross-border data transfers.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance:
     - Clarify in the policy that necessary cookies do not require explicit user consent.
     - Explicitly state any cross-border data transfers that occur due to third-party services used on the website.
     - Provide more information about how long cookies will be stored after being withdrawn by the user.
     - Consider adding a link to the full cookie policy in the banner for users to access easily."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-26.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides a mechanism for users to give explicit consent through the ""Accept all"" and ""Reject all"" options. However, it lacks a clear explanation of what type of cookies are included in each option, which could potentially lead to ambiguity and confusion among users.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily? Users can change their cookie settings at any time by visiting the cookie settings section. This meets the requirement for easy withdrawal of consent.
   - Are granular consent options provided? The policy provides some level of granularity by allowing users to accept or reject cookies based on categories (strictly necessary, performance, and marketing). However, it does not allow for the selection of individual cookies within these categories.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The policy mentions that cookies can be set by advertising partners via the website, which implies third-party data sharing. However, it would be more transparent if specific details about these partners are provided.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? There is no explicit mention of cross-border data transfers in the policy. This needs to be clarified as GDPR requires that data subjects are informed about where their personal data will be processed and whether it will be transferred outside the EU.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant - The policy does not provide clear and easily accessible information to data subjects about their rights in relation to cookies, as required by this article.
   - Article 7: Partially Compliant - The policy provides an option for users to give and withdraw consent, but it could be improved by providing a more detailed explanation of the types of cookies used and the purposes they serve.

5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it provides mechanisms for giving and withdrawing cookie consent, but it lacks clarity in explaining the types of cookies used, third-party data sharing, and cross-border data transfers, which are crucial aspects under GDPR.

6. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance compliance, the policy should:
   - Clearly label each category of cookies (strictly necessary, performance, marketing) to help users understand what type of data is being collected and for what purpose.
   - Provide specific details about third-party partners with whom data may be shared.
   - Clarify whether and where cross-border data transfers occur.
   - Supplement the existing consent mechanism with more detailed explanations about the types of cookies used and their purposes.
   - Ensure that information about users' rights in relation to cookies is easily accessible and clearly explained."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-28.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Consent Mechanisms:
      - Explicit consent is handled by providing the user with an option to accept or deny cookies upon visiting the website, however, it's not clear if this initial consent covers all purposes, as it seems that some functionalities might be enabled even without explicit consent.
      - Users can withdraw consent by using the settings to deny all cookies, but there isn't a straightforward and visible option for doing so directly from the cookie banner.
      - Granular consent options are provided in the settings, allowing users to accept or deny different categories of cookies.
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
      - Third-party data sharing is outlined in the Cookie Policy but it's not clearly stated on the initial cookie banner.
      - Cross-border data transfers are addressed, but they should be made more prominent and easily understandable for users.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
      - Article 4(11): Compliant (the policy defines ""personal data"" as data that can identify a natural person)
      - Article 7: Non-Compliant (+ Reason): The policy does not provide a clear and affirmative action from the user to opt-in for non-essential cookies, which is necessary under GDPR. Also, it's not evident if the user is adequately informed about the purpose of each category of cookies and their respective data processing activities.

5. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR due to the lack of clear and affirmative consent for non-essential cookies and a less transparent approach towards third-party data sharing and cross-border data transfers.
6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Make sure that users provide an explicit and affirmative action to opt-in for non-essential cookies.
   - Clearly outline third-party data sharing on the initial cookie banner.
   - Provide a more straightforward option for users to withdraw their consent directly from the cookie banner, in addition to the settings.
   - Ensure that users are adequately informed about the purpose of each category of cookies and their respective data processing activities."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-29.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled? Users are provided with the option to agree to all cookies or select specific categories of cookies they consent to, which can be changed at any time within the ""Settings"" section. This mechanism appears to handle explicit consent.
     - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can revoke their consent at any time by changing their cookie settings in the ""Settings"" section.
     - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, users have the option to choose specific categories of cookies they consent to, providing a level of granularity.

  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The policy mentions various third-party services used (e.g., Usercentrics Consent Management Platform, Matomo, Podigee, walls.io, YouTube Video). However, it would be beneficial to explicitly state that these partners may collect user data.
     - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? The policy does not address cross-border data transfers, which should be included if such transfers occur.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy does not explicitly define the terms ""controller"", ""processor"", or ""third party"" in line with Article 4(11), but it can be inferred that Daimler Truck AG acts as the controller due to their control over the processing of personal data.
     - Article 7: [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy provides users with clear information about the use of cookies and offers them the opportunity to give or withdraw their consent, making it compliant with Article 7. However, more explicit explanations regarding the legal basis for processing personal data could enhance compliance.

  5. Final Justification: While the cookie policy offers users a choice in accepting cookies and provides an easy way to revoke consent, there is room for improvement in terms of transparency about third-party data sharing and cross-border data transfers, as well as clearer explanations regarding the legal basis for processing personal data.

  6. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance compliance with GDPR, it is recommended that Daimler Truck AG:
     - Explicitly state in the policy that third-party services may collect user data and provide more information about these partners.
     - Address cross-border data transfers if they occur within the policy.
     - Clearly explain the legal basis for processing personal data, such as consent or legitimate interests, in the policy."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-3.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - Explicit consent is handled through the user's active selection of either ""Agree"" or ""Decline."" The ""Adjust"" option allows users to provide granular consent for specific purposes and functions.
     - Users can withdraw their consent easily by going back to the Cookie Policy and modifying their preferences.
     - Granular consent options are provided through the ""Adjust"" function, allowing users to choose which purposes and functions they consent to.
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Third-party data sharing is outlined in the policy, including the involvement of specific advertising partners such as The UK Trade Desk Ltd., Virtual Minds GmbH, Trakken GmbH.
     - Cross-border data transfers are not explicitly addressed within the given text.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant (Reason: There is no clear and concise definition of cookies and similar technologies used.)
     - Article 7: Compliant (Reason: Users are presented with a clear choice to accept or decline the use of cookies, and can later withdraw their consent if needed.)
  5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it provides mechanisms for user consent, but falls short in providing adequate transparency regarding the nature of cookies and cross-border data transfers.
  6. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Clearly define cookies and similar technologies used under Article 4(11) to ensure compliance with GDPR.
     - Explicitly address cross-border data transfers in the policy, providing information on safeguards used to protect user data during these transfers."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-30.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides an option to accept all cookies with a single click, which could be considered as implicit consent. However, the user can still manage their settings, thus offering the possibility of granular control and explicit consent.
     - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can revoke or change their consent at any time in the ""Cookie Settings.""
     - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, granular consent options are available as users can select individual settings for different categories of cookies.
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? Yes, the policy mentions that data may be transferred to and processed by third parties depending on their function. However, it would be more transparent to specify which exact third parties are involved.
     - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? No, there's no mention of cross-border data transfers in the provided cookie policy.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy provides a clear definition of personal data and identifies third parties that process personal data, which aligns with Article 4(11).
     - Article 7: [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] Since the user can revoke or change their consent at any time, the policy partially complies with Article 7. However, the initial request for consent could be more explicit and granular to ensure full compliance.
  5. Final Justification: The classification is based on the need for more transparency regarding third-party data sharing and cross-border data transfers, as well as making the initial request for consent more explicit and granular.
  6. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance compliance, it's recommended to clearly outline which specific third parties are involved in processing personal data, explicitly mention cross-border data transfers, and provide a more detailed and granular request for consent at the outset. Furthermore, consider offering an option to accept only essential cookies initially, allowing users to opt-in for other categories as desired."

   - The cookie policy provides some information about the use of cookies and third-party services like Google Analytics, Microsoft Clarity, and YouTube. It also offers the option to manage consent. However, there is no clear explanation of how personal data will be processed under Article 6(1)(a) DSGVO (Consent) and Article 4(11) DSGVO (controller's details).

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
      - Explicit consent is handled through a banner with two options: ""Accept everything"" and ""Settings"". However, the ""Accept everything"" option does not ensure granular consent as it accepts all cookies/functions listed, including third-party tracking. The ""Settings"" option allows users to choose specific categories of cookies/functions but still does not provide the granularity required by GDPR.
      - Users can withdraw their consent by modifying their selection in the ""Settings"" section or using the cookie button at the bottom of the website.
      - There is no option for obtaining active, affirmative consent through a checkbox for each category of cookies/functions.

  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
      - Third-party data sharing is outlined in the ""Settings"" section, where services like Google Analytics, Microsoft Clarity, and YouTube are listed. The use of Usercentrics Consent Management Platform and ID for requesting consent data is also mentioned. However, there's no clear explanation regarding data processing by these third parties outside the EU.
      - Cross-border data transfers are addressed but in a general manner. The USA is classified as a country with insufficient levels of data protection under EU standards, and further information on Google's data processing can be found.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant - No controller details are provided in the cookie policy.
     - Article 7: Partially Compliant - Explicit and informed consent is sought, but granularity is not ensured due to the lack of individual checkboxes for each category of cookies/functions.

  5. Final Justification: The classification is based on the lack of clear explanations regarding controller details, data processing under Article 6(1)(a) DSGVO, and granular consent options.

  6. Improvement Suggestions:
      - Provide detailed controller information in the cookie policy.
      - Implement individual checkboxes for each category of cookies/functions to ensure granular consent.
      - Explicitly state how data will be processed under Article 6(1)(a) DSGVO, and provide clear information about third-party data processing outside the EU (e.g., details on any appropriate safeguards)."

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides an option to accept all cookies, which implies explicit consent. However, it lacks a specific action that clearly indicates user acceptance (e.g., ticking a checkbox or clicking a button labeled ""Accept Cookies"").
     - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, the policy states that users can withdraw their consent at any time by following a link to a settings page.
     - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, the policy provides three categories of cookies: Strictly Necessary, Functional, and Targeting, allowing users to make specific choices about the types of cookies they accept.
3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The policy mentions that functional and targeting cookies may be set by third-party providers, but it does not specify who these providers are or where the data is transferred to.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? The policy acknowledges that functional and targeting cookies may involve transferring user data to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA), but it does not provide information about the measures taken to ensure adequate protection of this data.
4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): The policy mentions cookies, which can be seen as ""data processing operations,"" but it does not specify whether these involve automated decision-making or profiling. [Non-Compliant]
   - Article 7: The policy provides a mechanism for obtaining and withdrawing user consent to the use of cookies. However, it lacks clear and distinct information about the purposes of the processing and the identity of the data controller. [Partially Compliant]
5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it provides granular consent options and allows users to easily withdraw their consent. However, it fails to comply with GDPR requirements regarding transparency, specifically in outlining third-party data sharing and providing clear information about the purposes of processing and the identity of the data controller.
6. Improvement Suggestions: To improve compliance, the policy could be updated to include more specific details about third-party data sharing, such as the identities of these providers and the countries where the data may be transferred. Additionally, it should provide clear and distinct information about the purposes of processing and the identity of the data controller in accordance with Article 7 of GDPR."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-33.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - Explicit consent is handled by requiring users to actively accept cookies through a banner. However, it does not seem to provide the option to reject non-essential cookies separately, which could lead to ambiguity about what consent was granted.
     - Users can withdraw consent by changing their cookie settings, but the simplicity of the ""Deny and continue"" button might not be easily noticeable or intuitive for all users.
     - Granular consent options are provided, as users can selectively enable/disable various categories of cookies (Marketing, Functional, Essential). However, it is unclear if users understand which specific functionalities correspond to these categories.
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Third-party data sharing is outlined by listing the services used on the website under 'Services'. The category 'AllData Transfer to Third Countries' seems to suggest international data transfers, but no further information is provided about the recipients, purposes, or safeguards.
     - Cross-border data transfers are not explicitly addressed in the policy.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant (The policy does not provide a clear and easily accessible explanation of the processing operations, including the purposes, that are based on legitimate interests).
     - Article 7: Partially Compliant (While users can actively give their consent for cookies, there is room for improvement in providing more granular options and transparency about the consequences of refusing or withdrawing consent.)
  5. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements due to its explicit request for user consent and the provision of granular cookie categories. However, it fails to meet the standards for transparency in data sharing, international data transfers, and legitimate interest processing.
  6. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Clearly outline the purposes and recipients of any third-party data transfers, including those to countries outside the EU.
     - Explicitly address cross-border data transfers in the policy and provide information about appropriate safeguards used (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses, Privacy Shield).
     - Enhance transparency by explaining the legitimate interests behind processing operations based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
     - Provide more detailed descriptions for each cookie category and functionality to aid users in making informed decisions about their consent."

     - Granular consent options are provided, as users can choose which specific technologies they allow or deny.
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Third-party data sharing is outlined in detail under the provided links for each technology mentioned.
     - Cross-border data transfers are not explicitly addressed, but since most of the mentioned technologies are global platforms, it can be assumed that cross-border data transfers occur.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): The policy defines ""personal data"" and ""processing"", so it is Compliant.
     - Article 7: The policy provides mechanisms for obtaining and managing user consent, but it does not clearly specify the specific conditions under which processing is based (e.g., legitimate interest), so it is Partially Compliant.
  5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it lacks clear specification of the specific conditions under Article 7 for obtaining and managing user consent.
  6. Improvement Suggestions: To fully comply with GDPR, the policy should clearly specify the specific conditions under which processing is based (e.g., legitimate interest) as outlined in Article 7. This will provide users with a better understanding of why their data is being processed and how it is being used. Additionally, the policy could explicitly address cross-border data transfers to ensure transparency regarding where user data may be transferred."

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides users with an option to accept or decline the use of cookies, which could be considered as explicit consent. However, it does not offer granular control over different types of cookies.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily? Users can change their settings at any time through the ""Cookies Settings"" link provided in the policy. This is a satisfactory mechanism for withdrawing consent.
   - Are granular consent options provided? The policy does not provide granular control over different types of cookies, which is a key requirement under GDPR. Users can only choose to allow all cookies or manage their preferences, but they are not informed about the specific purposes and functionalities of each type of cookie.

  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The policy does not explicitly mention third-party data sharing. It only states that ""Services from other companies (autonomous third-party providers)"" are included in the functional cookies category, but it does not specify what services these might be or how user data is shared with them.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? The policy does not mention cross-border data transfers, which could potentially involve transferring user data to countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) that may have different data protection laws.

     - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? There is no information about cross-border data transfers in the provided policy text. (Non-Compliant)
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): The policy does not define the terms 'controller' and 'processor', which is required under Article 4(11). (Non-Compliant)
     - Article 7: The policy does not appear to comply with the requirement for explicit, informed, and freely given consent under Article 7. (Non-Compliant)
  5. Final Justification: The cookie policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it lacks several essential elements such as granular control over cookies, the option to withdraw consent, transparency about third-party data sharing and cross-border data transfers, and explicit, informed, and freely given consent.
  6. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Provide granular control over each type of cookie so that users can give their explicit consent.
     - Implement an easy way for users to withdraw their consent at any time.
     - Explicitly outline third-party data sharing practices and address cross-border data transfers in the policy.
     - Define the terms 'controller' and 'processor' as required under GDPR Article 4(11).
     - Ensure that the method of obtaining consent meets the requirements of GDPR Article 7, providing clear and concise information about each cookie and its purpose."

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides a mechanism for users to give their consent by accepting all cookies or managing cookie settings. However, the ""Accept all Cookies"" option does not provide granular control over which specific cookies are accepted, thus not meeting the requirements of explicit consent as per GDPR.
     - Can users withdraw consent easily? Users can manage their cookie preferences at any time through the provided link to 'Manage Cookie Settings' or the Privacy Preference Center, which allows them to withdraw their consent. This is in compliance with GDPR.
     - Are granular consent options provided? As mentioned earlier, the option to accept all cookies does not provide granular control over specific cookies. This needs improvement for full GDPR compliance.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The policy mentions that information collected about users may be transferred outside the EEA as described in the Privacy Policy, but it does not specify which third parties this data may be shared with. This needs to be addressed for full compliance.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? The policy states that information may be transferred outside the EEA, but it should also mention whether appropriate safeguards are in place as required by GDPR (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield certification).

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): The policy does not provide a clear definition of the terms ""personal data"" and ""consent"", which are essential for GDPR compliance as per Article 4(11). This needs to be addressed.
   - Article 7: While the policy provides an option to give consent, it does not ensure that the user's consent is given freely, specifically, without deterrence, and any conveyed in an intelligible and easily accessible form, as required by Article 7(4). The lack of granular control over specific cookies deters from freely giving consent.

5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant due to the lack of clear definitions, insufficient granularity in the consent mechanism, and unclear data sharing practices.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Clearly define the terms ""personal data"" and ""consent"".
   - Provide granular control over specific cookies to ensure explicit and freely given consent.
   - Specify which third parties data may be shared with, if any.
   - Address cross-border data transfers by mentioning appropriate safeguards in place (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield certification)."

   - The policy provides some information about the use of cookies, the consent mechanism, and a link to the Cookie Policy. However, it lacks clarity on third-party data sharing, cross-border data transfers, and granular consent options.

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled?
       - The policy mentions that users must give consent for the use of cookies, but it does not clearly state if the consent is explicit (i.e., an active opt-in).
     - Can users withdraw consent easily?
       - Users can revoke their consent with effect for the future, which indicates some level of compliance in this regard.
     - Are granular consent options provided?
       - The policy does not provide a clear option to selectively accept or reject specific types of cookies. This is an area that needs improvement.

  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined?
       - While the policy mentions ""third-party providers,"" it does not explicitly detail who these parties are, what data they receive, or for what purposes they process this data.
     - Are cross-border data transfers addressed?
       - The policy does not address if or how cross-border data transfers are handled. This is a significant concern under GDPR as it may involve transferring personal data to countries outside the EU without adequate protection.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): [Non-Compliant + Reason]
       - The policy does not provide a clear explanation of ""third-party providers"" as defined in Article 4(11) of the GDPR, which could lead to confusion for users.
     - Article 7: [Partially Compliant + Reason]
       - While the policy mentions that users must give consent for the use of cookies, it does not explicitly state if the consent is freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous (as required by Article 7). Additionally, granular consent options are lacking.

  5. Final Justification:
     - The main reason for the classification is that while the policy acknowledges some aspects of GDPR compliance, it lacks clarity on key details such as third-party data sharing, cross-border data transfers, and granular consent options.

  6. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance include:
       a) Clearly stating the types of cookies used and providing granular consent options to users.
       b) Detailing third-party providers involved in the processing of personal data, including their identities, purposes, and locations.
       c) Explicitly addressing cross-border data transfers and the measures taken to ensure adequate protection under GDPR regulations.

   - The policy provides information about the use of cookies, the possibility to adjust preferences, and a link to the privacy notice which should contain the necessary information for GDPR compliance. However, it lacks explicit consent mechanism for non-essential cookies and does not adequately address data retention and data protection rights.

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled? (Partially Compliant): The policy offers the options ""Only essential"", ""Set preferences"", and ""Accept all"". However, it does not offer a clear option to only accept essential cookies without accepting non-essential ones, which would be necessary for valid user consent.
     - Can users withdraw consent easily? (Partially Compliant): Users can adjust their preferences at any time, but the policy does not specify how long the data will be retained or if the withdrawn consent affects previous data processing.
     - Are granular consent options provided? (Partially Compliant): The ""Set preferences"" option allows users to manage various categories of cookies, but it is not clear which specific trackers or analytic tools are associated with each category.

  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? (Partially Compliant): The policy mentions sharing data with third parties like Facebook and Google, but it does not specify the purpose of this sharing, what data is shared, or the recipient's identity beyond being a marketing partner.
     - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? (Partially Compliant): The policy mentions data processing in the USA and China, but it does not provide adequate safeguards for these transfers such as Standard Contractual Clauses, Binding Corporate Rules, or Privacy Shield certification.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): [Non-Compliant + Reason]: The policy does not define the terms ""controller"" and ""processor"", which are essential for demonstrating compliance with this article.
     - Article 7: [Partially Compliant + Reason]: The policy offers the option to accept or reject cookies, but it does not meet the requirements of Article 7 as it does not provide clear and concise information about the processing operations, the legal basis for processing, and the consequences of not providing consent.

  5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it provides some transparency regarding the use of cookies, offers an option to adjust preferences, and links to a privacy notice. However, it lacks adequate explanations about third-party data sharing, cross-border data transfers, and explicit consent mechanisms for non-essential cookies.

  6. Improvement Suggestions:
    - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance:
      - Provide clear options for users to accept or reject specific categories of cookies, including essential and non-essential ones.
      - Offer granular control over the trackers or analytic tools associated with each category.
      - Clearly outline third-party data sharing purposes, recipients, and safeguards for cross-border data transfers.
      - Define the terms ""controller"" and ""processor"" as required by Article 4(11).
      - Provide clear and concise information about processing operations, legal basis for processing, and consequences of not providing consent in line with Article 7 requirements."

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides explicit consent options for various categories of cookies, but it could be improved by making the purpose and scope of data processing more clear to users at the point of obtaining consent.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily? Users can revoke their consent through the Utiq data protection portal or within ""Customize"" settings. However, the policy should make this process simpler and more straightforward for users.
   - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, granular consent options are offered by allowing users to choose which types of cookies they want based on different purposes and functions.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The policy outlines the involvement of partners (including joint controllers) for various cookie functions, but it could provide more specific details about each third-party involved in data processing.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? The policy mentions the use of Utiq technology and its implications for cross-platform recognition via telecom provider data, which involves cross-border data transfer. However, further information should be provided on how this transfer is secured and complies with GDPR regulations.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): The policy provides definitions for some terms related to processing operations but does not seem to address ""controller in common with another controller"" as required by Article 4(11). This oversight could lead to non-compliance if not addressed.
   - Article 7: The policy offers the opportunity to give explicit consent for specific purposes, which aligns with the requirements outlined in Article 7 of the GDPR. However, the language used could be more transparent and user-friendly, making it easier for users to understand their rights.

5. Final Justification: Partially compliant due to the lack of clarity on third-party data sharing, cross-border data transfer mechanisms, and Article 4(11) compliance regarding controllers in common with another controller.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance include providing more detailed information about third-party data processors involved, addressing the Article 4(11) requirement, offering clearer language when explaining users' rights and consent options, and improving the user experience to make it easier for them to withdraw their consent or revise their preferences."

     - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? (Compliant) - Yes, the policy lists all the third-party vendors used on the website, and users can adjust their privacy settings based on specific purposes and/or at a vendor level.
     - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? (Partially Compliant) - While there is no explicit mention of cross-border data transfers in the policy, it is likely that such transfers occur given the use of third-party vendors from various locations. The policy should clarify this issue to ensure full compliance with GDPR requirements.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): [Partially Compliant + Reason] - While the policy mentions the term ""vendor"" multiple times, it does not provide a clear definition of what constitutes a processor or a controller, as required by Article 4(11).
     - Article 7: [Compliant + Reason] - The policy offers users the opportunity to give and withdraw their consent for specific purposes, which aligns with the requirements set out in Article 7.

  5. Final Justification:
     - The main reason for the classification is that while the cookie policy provides transparency about cookies, third-party vendors, and purpose categories, it lacks specific details about how explicit consent is handled in certain cases, such as when users' personal data are processed based on legitimate business interest, and does not explicitly address cross-border data transfers.

  6. Improvement Suggestions:

       - Yes, users can adjust their cookie settings at any time according to their wishes through the provided options.
     - Are granular consent options provided?
       - Yes, users have granular control over different types of cookies: Strictly necessary cookies, Performance cookies, Functional cookies, and Marketing and targeting cookies.

  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined?
       - The policy states that third-party recipients may receive data collected through cookies but does not explicitly name them, which could lead to confusion about who is receiving the data.
     - Are cross-border data transfers addressed?
       - There's no mention of cross-border data transfers in the provided cookie policy. However, it directs users to read the General Privacy Policy for more information.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): [Non-Compliant + Reason]
       - The policy does not clearly define 'controller' or 'processor', as required under Article 4(11).
     - Article 7: [Partially Compliant + Reason]
       - While the policy explains that users give their consent, it is not clear whether this is a freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous form of consent. The explicit mention of 'explicit' consent could help meet this requirement better.

  5. Final Justification:
     - The policy does provide some essential information but lacks clarity in certain areas such as the lifespan of cookies, third-party recipients, and cross-border data transfers. Additionally, it does not fully comply with GDPR Article 4(11) and Article 7 requirements.

  6. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Clarify the lifespan of cookies in the policy.
     - Clearly name the third-party recipients that receive data collected through cookies.
     - Explicitly state that users' consent is given freely, specifically, and unambiguously as required under GDPR Article 7.
     - Include information about cross-border data transfers in the policy or direct users to a specific section in the General Privacy Policy that addresses this issue.
     - Define 'controller' and 'processor' according to Article 4(11) of the GDPR."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-5.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Consent Mechanisms:
      - Explicit consent is handled by requiring users to actively opt-in, but the initial option of ""Allow all"" may be seen as overly broad and non-granular. Users can change their preferences in the 'More options' section, providing granular control, but this does not meet the GDPR requirement for obtaining explicit consent at the time of first data collection.
      - Users can withdraw consent easily via the Privacy Settings, but the initial opt-in may not be seen as fully compliant with GDPR due to the overly broad ""Allow all"" option.
      - While there are granular options provided in the 'More options' section, users are not presented with these choices at the time of first data collection, which is a requirement under GDPR.
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
      - Third-party data sharing is clearly outlined as data will be processed by 43 partners and providers.
      - Cross-border data transfers are not explicitly addressed in the policy text provided.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
      - Article 4(11): [Non-Compliant] - The term ""personal data"" is defined but the specific data categories being processed or shared are not clearly outlined, which may cause confusion for users.
      - Article 7: [Partially Compliant] - While explicit consent is obtained, it may not be in a manner that fully complies with GDPR due to the overly broad ""Allow all"" option presented to users initially.
  5. Final Justification:
      - The policy provides some level of transparency and allows for user control over their data, but it does not meet all requirements under GDPR, particularly in terms of obtaining explicit consent at the time of first data collection and addressing cross-border data transfers.
  6. Improvement Suggestions:
      - Modify the initial consent screen to present users with granular options, allowing them to give or withhold consent for specific processing purposes, as required by GDPR.
      - Clearly address cross-border data transfers in the policy text, outlining any appropriate safeguards in place to protect user data when transferred outside of the EU/EEA.
      - Revise the definition of ""personal data"" to clearly outline specific data categories being processed or shared with third parties."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-50.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides options for users to give their explicit consent by clicking ""Accept all"" or ""Decline all"". However, it may not be fully clear that the user's consent is required as there doesn't seem to be a pre-cookie setter notification.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can revoke their consent at any time which has no influence on the lawfulness of previous processing.
   - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, the policy offers separate options for analytics and marketing. However, it would be beneficial to provide more detailed granular consent options as necessary to meet GDPR requirements.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The text mentions that data is passed on to service providers but does not specify who these providers are or where they are located (within the EU or third countries). A more detailed explanation would be necessary for full compliance with GDPR.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? Yes, there is a mention of data being transferred to third countries, and users are directed to the Privacy Policy for further information. However, it should be made clearer that such transfers involve potential risks as per Article 49 (1) GDPR.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): [Non-Compliant] The cookie policy does not explicitly state the specific cookies used and their respective purposes, which are required elements under Article 4(11).
   - Article 7: [Partially Compliant] The policy provides options for users to give their consent but could be improved by ensuring more detailed granular consent options and a clearer pre-cookie setter notification.

5. Final Justification: The main reason for the partial classification is that while the policy does offer some level of transparency, it falls short in providing the necessary granularity, clarity, and specificity required by GDPR.

6. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance compliance, UNIPER could consider adding a pre-cookie setter notification, offering more detailed granular consent options for analytics, marketing, and other potential purposes of cookie usage, and explicitly listing the specific cookies used with their respective purposes under Article 4(11) GDPR. Additionally, further clarification on third-party data sharing and cross-border data transfers would be beneficial."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-6.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides an option to accept all cookies or choose specific categories, which represents a form of granular consent. However, it does not specifically ask for explicit consent for each type of cookie.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can change their selection at any time under ""Cookie Settings"" at the bottom of the page and revoke consent with effect for the future.
   - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, users are given an option to choose specific categories (required, external services, statistics, marketing) of cookies they want to accept or decline.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? Yes, the policy clearly outlines that third-party services like Google Maps are used and mentions potential legal risks associated with data transfers outside the EU/EEA.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? Yes, users are informed about data transfers outside the EU/EEA (e.g., to the USA) when they accept processing, which includes possible access by government authorities and limitations in enforcing data protection rights.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant + Reason: The policy does not explicitly state whether or not ""cookie"" is considered personal data under the GDPR, which should be addressed to comply with Article 4(11).
   - Article 7: Compliant + Reason: Users are presented with clear and specific information about their options regarding cookie usage and given the ability to withdraw consent easily, aligning with the requirements of Article 7.

5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it provides granular consent options, outlines data sharing transparency, and allows users to withdraw consent easily, but there are areas that need improvement, such as explicitly stating whether ""cookie"" is considered personal data under the GDPR (Article 4(11)).

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance include making explicit reference to ""cookies"" as personal data under Article 4(11), ensuring that cookie consent requests are presented in a way that is easily understandable and unambiguous, and providing clear and concise information about the purpose of each type of cookie used on the website. Additionally, it may be beneficial to provide users with more information about their rights as data subjects under the GDPR and how they can exercise those rights."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-7.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides an opt-in mechanism for users to consent to the use of cookies, which aligns with GDPR requirements. However, it could be improved by making it more obvious and user-friendly.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can adjust their preferences at any time through the Privacy Settings.
   - Are granular consent options provided? The policy offers some level of granularity in allowing users to accept all processing purposes or activate only necessary technologies. However, it does not provide a way for users to selectively accept/reject individual cookies.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? Yes, the policy provides details about third-party services used (e.g., Google Ads Conversion, YouTube, Web Analysis Tool: AT Internet, etc.) but does not explicitly mention whether user data is shared with these parties or where it may be transferred.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? The policy mentions that processing of personal data in the USA by Facebook and YouTube requires explicit consent under Art. 49 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR, acknowledging the risk of access by US authorities. However, it does not provide further details about cross-border transfers for other third-party services.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] - The policy provides definitions of key terms related to the processing of personal data, making it partially compliant with this article. However, it does not explicitly mention the data controller and processor, which should be clearly identified in accordance with GDPR requirements.
   - Article 7: [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] - The policy provides a clear and comprehensive notice about the use of cookies, allowing users to give or withdraw their consent in a straightforward manner. However, it does not explicitly state that users have the right to object at any time to the processing of their personal data for direct marketing purposes (which is required under Article 7(4) GDPR).

5. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements by providing a mechanism for obtaining and managing user consent, but it could be improved in terms of transparency about third-party data sharing and cross-border data transfers, as well as the explicit mention of users' rights under Article 7(4) GDPR.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Clearly identify the data controller and processor within the policy.
   - Provide more detailed information about third-party data sharing and cross-border data transfers, including any relevant safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield).
   - Explicitly state users' right to object at any time to the processing of their personal data for direct marketing purposes under Article 7(4) GDPR.
   - Improve the user interface and user experience when managing cookie settings, making it easier for users to make informed choices about the cookies they accept or reject."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-8.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled? The policy uses a clear and easy-to-understand notice, and the user's action (clicking ""OK"") serves as an expression of consent. However, it is not immediately apparent that this action constitutes consent, which could lead to ambiguity.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can modify or revoke their consent in the Privacy Information section. This meets the GDPR requirement for easy withdrawal.
   - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, users are presented with four categories of cookies: Necessary, Preference, Statistics, and Marketing. They have the option to accept or deny these categories individually. However, more detailed information about each category could improve understanding and compliance.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? Yes, the policy mentions that some cookies are placed by third parties appearing on their pages, but it does not specify which third parties these may be or the purpose of the data sharing. This could be improved to provide more transparency.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? No, there is no mention of cross-border data transfers in the policy. It should be made clear whether and how personal data may be transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA).

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): The definition of cookies is provided, which meets this requirement. However, it does not specify that persistent identifiers like local storage or similar technologies are also considered as cookies. This should be addressed to ensure full compliance with Article 4(11).
   - Article 7: Users are clearly informed about the use of cookies and their right to withdraw consent, but explicit and granular consent is not always freely given, since it is bundled with the continued use of the site (i.e., by clicking ""OK""). This could be improved to ensure compliance with Article 7.

5. Final Justification: The policy meets several GDPR requirements, but falls short in areas such as explicit and granular consent and providing complete transparency regarding third-party data sharing and cross-border data transfers.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Clearly state that clicking ""OK"" constitutes consent
   - Provide more detailed information about each cookie category (e.g., specific third parties involved, purpose of data collection)
   - Address Article 4(11) by specifying persistent identifiers like local storage or similar technologies as cookies
   - Explicitly address cross-border data transfers and ensure appropriate safeguards are in place
   - Consider offering an option to provide granular consent without requiring users to continue using the site after giving it."
advanced_explanation,compliant,compliant-9.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides an option to explicitly accept all purposes by clicking ""Allow All."" However, users are not asked for consent separately for each purpose, which is a requirement under GDPR.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can revoke their consent at any time by accessing the Privacy Settings at the bottom of the website.
   - Are granular consent options provided? No, the policy does not offer separate and clear consent for each type of cookie or processing purpose as required under GDPR.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? Yes, the policy lists all partners and services that process personal data, such as Adform, Facebook Pixel, Google Ads Conversion Tracking, etc.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? The policy does not specifically address this issue. It is important to note that for any data transferred outside of the EU/EEA, appropriate safeguards must be in place.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant + Reason: The policy does not explicitly define ""controller"" and ""processor,"" as required by Article 4(11).
   - Article 7: Non-Compliant + Reason: The policy does not offer separate, informed, and unambiguous consent for each purpose of data processing, which is a requirement under Article 7.

5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it provides some transparency regarding the use of cookies and third-party partners but lacks granularity in obtaining explicit and separate consent for each purpose.

6. Improvement Suggestions: To improve compliance, the following actionable steps can be taken:
   - Offer a clear and concise description of each type of cookie and processing purpose, allowing users to give separate and informed consent for each one.
   - Explicitly define ""controller"" and ""processor"" in accordance with Article 4(11).
   - If cross-border data transfers are taking place, ensure that appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield certifications are in place."
advanced_explanation,non_compliant,non_Compliant-27.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled? The cookie policy provides an option to accept all cookies or customize the choice, but the technical cookies do not require explicit consent, which may not be in compliance with GDPR as users should be informed and have the right to reject non-essential cookies.
     - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can withdraw their consent at any time through the settings.
     - Are granular consent options provided? The policy provides options for customizing cookie choices, but technical cookies cannot be activated or deactivated individually, which may not meet the requirements for granularity in GDPR.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? Yes, the policy mentions that cookies are used to share data with third parties for various purposes such as marketing, audience measurement, and performance improvements.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? Yes, the policy mentions that data may be transferred to third countries outside the European Economic Area without an adequate level of protection under data protection law (esp. USA), but it does not specify the measures taken to ensure appropriate safeguards for such transfers.
4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant + Reason: The policy does not define the term ""cookie"" in a manner consistent with Article 4(11), which may lead to confusion about what data is being processed.
   - Article 7: Partially Compliant + Reason: While users are informed about cookies and given the option to consent, the lack of granularity in controlling non-essential cookies may not fully comply with the requirements of Article 7 regarding clear and specific information and choices for data subjects.
5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant as it does not provide a clear way for users to control all types of cookies, specifically technical cookies, which are essential for the website's functioning but may still process personal data. This lack of granularity may not fully comply with GDPR requirements.
6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance: To improve compliance, the policy should provide clearer information about cookies and their purposes, as well as a way for users to control all types of cookies, including technical cookies, in a more granular manner. The policy could also specify measures taken to ensure appropriate safeguards for cross-border data transfers. It is recommended to consult with a legal expert or data protection officer to ensure compliance with GDPR."

     - Explicit consent is requested, but users cannot easily withdraw consent or adjust cookie settings once enabled. Granular options are provided for different categories of cookies.
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Third-party data sharing with marketing and analytics partners (such as Google Ads, Facebook Pixel, LinkedIn Insight Tag) is outlined, but cross-border data transfers do not seem to be addressed explicitly.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): The policy does not provide a clear definition of ""personal data"", which is non-compliant (Needs to specify that personal data includes any information that can identify a natural person).
     - Article 7: Consent is requested for cookies, but it's unclear if the request is made in an accessible, easy-to-understand manner (Needs to ensure that the language used is clear and concise, and users are able to give or withdraw consent freely).
  5. Final Justification: The policy only partially complies with GDPR due to the lack of explicit information on cross-border data transfers and a need for better clarity in consent mechanisms.
  6. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Explicitly address cross-border data transfers, ensuring that appropriate safeguards are in place (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield certification).
     - Implement a mechanism that allows users to withdraw their consent easily and adjust cookie settings at any time. Make sure the language used is clear and concise so that users can understand what they're agreeing to when giving consent. Additionally, provide information on how to contact the data controller if users have questions or concerns regarding data protection."

     - Cross-border data transfers are not explicitly mentioned, but it can be assumed that some of the listed third-party services may process data outside the EU.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): The policy does not provide a clear definition of ""consent"" as required by this article. [Non-Compliant]
     - Article 7: The policy does not specify that consent is specific, informed, and freely given before the processing begins, which is a requirement under this article. [Non-Compliant]
  5. Final Justification: The policy fails to comply with GDPR requirements because it lacks clear definitions of ""consent"" and does not ensure that consent is obtained in a specific, informed, and freely given manner before data processing begins.
  6. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Clearly define ""consent"" in line with GDPR Article 4(11).
     - Ensure that users are presented with granular consent options before any data collection occurs.

   - How is explicit consent handled? The cookie policy allows users to explicitly give or withdraw their consent, but the initial notice does not clearly specify which cookies are strictly necessary and which are not.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can revoke their consent at any time via the Cookie Policy settings.
   - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, users can customize their cookie preferences in the Cookie Settings section.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The policy mentions that non-essential cookies may be used for personalized advertising and content delivery (implies third-party data sharing). However, it does not provide specific details about the third parties involved.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? Yes, the policy informs users that if they consent to non-essential cookies, their data may be processed in the USA, acknowledging potential risks due to insufficient data protection levels.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant - The policy does not provide a clear and easily accessible description of cookie settings or the purpose of each individual cookie.
   - Article 7: Partially Compliant - While users are informed about data processing, the initial notice could be more specific and transparent regarding which cookies are necessary for website functionality and which are not.

5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR due to the lack of clarity in explaining necessary and non-essential cookies, as well as a need for further improvement in providing detailed information about third parties involved in data sharing.

  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Third-party data sharing is outlined in the policy, but it would be more transparent if specific partners were named.
     - Cross-border data transfers are not explicitly addressed.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): The policy does not clearly define ""cookie"" as per the GDPR definition (Non-Compliant). It is necessary to define a cookie, especially persistent cookies or similar technologies, as ""any form of storage and retrieval mechanism that may be used within the context of a website.""
     - Article 7: The policy provides a clear and easily accessible means for users to give and withdraw consent (Compliant). However, it is not explicitly stated that consent will only be obtained when necessary (e.g., before setting non-essential cookies) (Partially Compliant).
  5. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR regulations as it provides options for users to give and withdraw cookie consent, but it requires improvement in defining cookies, disclosing third-party data sharing partners, and addressing cross-border data transfers.
  6. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Define a cookie per the GDPR definition to ensure clarity.
     - Disclose specific third-party data sharing partners.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Third-party data sharing is outlined (Marketing Through Partners), and cross-border data transfers are addressed. However, the level of detail could be improved to make it clearer which partners may receive user data.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): The policy mentions ""cookies and similar technologies,"" which aligns with the definition provided in Article 4(11). [Compliant]
   - Article 7: The policy provides a clear, concise statement regarding the use of cookies, how users can withdraw consent, and offers granular options for consent. However, it could be argued that the initial default setting (Accept All) does not meet the ""clear and affirmative action"" requirement in Article 7(4). [Partially Compliant]

5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it provides a mechanism for obtaining user consent but may require improvement in its handling of defaults to ensure they reflect the clear and affirmative action required by GDPR.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To improve compliance with Article 7, change the initial default setting from ""Accept All"" to either ""Only Required"" or clearly indicate that it requires user consent before activating analytics and marketing cookies.
   - Provide more detailed information about which partners may receive user data through third-party data sharing. This would help users understand exactly who they are sharing their data with, as required by GDPR."

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides multiple options for user consent, including ""One-Click Opt-In"" and ""Reject All"". However, the granular consent options within ""Cookie Settings"" may not be sufficiently clear to users, making informed consent questionable.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can adjust their settings at any time, which implies they can revoke their consent.
   - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, users have the ability to customize and manage their consent for different types of cookies and tracking. However, the clarity and ease-of-use of these options could be improved for better user understanding.
3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The policy mentions that partner data sharing may occur for marketing and analysis purposes. This is a clear indication of third-party data sharing, but the partners themselves are not explicitly listed.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? There is no explicit mention of cross-border data transfers; however, it can be inferred that partnerships with other companies may involve international data exchanges.
4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy includes information about the use of cookies and tracking technologies, aligning with the definition provided in Article 4(11).
   - Article 7: [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy does offer users multiple consent options; however, it is questionable if users can provide explicit and informed consent due to the complexity of the presented choices. Additionally, the option for ""One-Click Opt-In"" may not comply with the requirement for explicit consent in some cases.
5. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR regulations as it offers multiple consent options and allows users to adjust their settings at any time. However, the granularity of the presented choices and the clarity around third-party data sharing could be improved for a more informed user experience.
6. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance compliance with GDPR, consider simplifying the consent options to ensure that users can provide explicit and informed consent. Also, provide more transparency regarding which partners are involved in data sharing and clearly explain any cross-border data transfers.

     - Third-party data sharing is mentioned, but it would be more transparent to specify which third parties are involved and what types of data are shared. Cross-border data transfers are not addressed in the policy.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): The policy does not define ""personal data breach"" explicitly, making it Non-Compliant.
     - Article 7: Since consent is not clearly distinguished as being separate from the performance of a contract or required for lawful compliance, and there's no provision for easy withdrawal of consent before using the site, it can be considered Non-Compliant.

5. Final Justification: The policy is Partially Compliant due to insufficient clarifications on data breach definitions and unclear user consent mechanisms.
6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Add an explicit ""I accept"" option to the cookie banner, ensuring users understand the policy before interacting with the site.
   - Clearly define personal data breaches as required by Article 4(11).
   - Distinguish between user consent for cookies and other interactions (e.g., performance of a contract or lawful compliance) to comply with Article 7.

      - Third-party data sharing is outlined, as mentioned for statistics/range measurement and marketing purposes. However, more information on the third parties involved and their locations should be provided to ensure complete transparency.
      - Cross-border data transfers are addressed, but there's no mention of appropriate safeguards in place (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield certification).

   4. GDPR Article Compliance:
      - Article 4(11): The policy provides a clear explanation of the term ""cookie,"" so it can be considered compliant with this article.
      - Article 7: As users are given the option to actively consent or decline cookies, and their choices are stored for future visits, the policy appears to be compliant with Article 7. However, more information on the cookie settings' implementation is needed to confirm compliance.

   5. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR because it offers granular consent options and allows users to withdraw their consent. However, it lacks detailed information about third-party data sharing and cross-border data transfers.

   6. Improvement Suggestions:
      - Provide more details on the third parties involved in data processing and their locations.
      - Clearly explain the steps users can take to withdraw their consent or delete cookies from their browser.
      - Implement appropriate safeguards for cross-border data transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield certification."

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled? The policy allows users to give explicit consent by accepting the cookie disclaimer, providing options for granting full consent or limiting it to necessary cookies only. However, the default setting for functional and targeting cookies is off but requires user consent to become active, which may not be in compliance with GDPR as these cookies are considered non-essential.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily? Users can change their cookie settings at any time through the ""Cookie Settings"" option.
   - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, users are given granular options to accept only necessary cookies or customize their preferences further in the ""Cookie Settings.""

3. Data Sharing Transparency:

   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? The policy does not explicitly address cross-border data transfers.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant - The policy does not provide a clear definition of cookies and does not distinguish between strictly necessary, functional, and targeting cookies as required by the GDPR.
   - Article 7: Partially Compliant - Users are given an opportunity to give or withdraw their consent, but the default setting for non-essential cookies may not be in compliance with the GDPR as these cookies require explicit consent before becoming active.

5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it provides options for users to give and withdraw their consent, but the default settings for functional and targeting cookies are not strictly in line with GDPR requirements.

6. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance compliance, consider updating the policy by defining cookies as per GDPR Article 4(11) and ensuring that non-essential cookies are not active until explicit user consent is given. Also, explicitly address third-party data sharing and cross-border data transfers in the policy to ensure full GDPR compliance."

Title: Cookie Policy

1. Introduction
   - Brief explanation of what cookies are and their purpose.
   - Mention that almost every website uses cookies.
   - Explanation that first-party cookies are placed by the website, while third-party cookies may be placed by other providers whose content is integrated into the website.

2. Managing Cookies
   - Detailed instructions on how to manage cookie settings via the features on the website and through changing browser settings.
   - Explanation that certain features might not function optimally if cookies are disabled or blocked.

3. Cookie Consent and Withdrawal
   - Explanation of the option to accept, reject, or withdraw consent for analytics and marketing cookies.
   - Warning that refusing cookies won't result in less advertising but rather means that the displayed advertising isn't tailored to the user's personal needs.

4. Cookie Processing and Transfer
   - Explanation of where the information collected via cookies is primarily processed (within the extended European Union).
   - Acknowledgment that in some cases, cookie information may be processed by service providers or third-party cookie providers outside the extended EU, which may not provide an equivalent level of data protection.
   - Mention of additional security measures implemented to protect the information collected by cookies.

5. Conclusion
   - Summary of the main points covered in the policy.

Analysis:
The text appears to be well-structured and easy to understand, with clear instructions on how users can manage their cookie preferences. However, it could benefit from providing more detailed explanations about the types of cookies used on the website, as well as the specific purposes for which they are used. It would also be helpful to clarify whether essential cookies (which are necessary for the functioning of the website) require user consent. The text could also be made more engaging by using headings and bullet points to break up the content into smaller, easier-to-digest sections. Overall, it is a clear and informative cookie policy that effectively communicates the relevant information to users."
advanced_explanation,non_compliant,non_compliant-23.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant
   - The cookie policy provides information about the use of cookies, types of cookies used, and how users can manage their preferences. However, it does not explicitly state the purpose of each cookie, which is a requirement under GDPR.

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
      - How is explicit consent handled?
        - Explicit consent is sought from users when they visit the website, but it is not clear if this is given through a pop-up or banner that requires active acceptance. This may not meet the standard of ""clear and affirmative action"" required by GDPR.
      - Can users withdraw consent easily?
        - Users can revoke their consent at any time in the Cookie Manager, which suggests that withdrawal is possible, but it's not immediately clear upon first visit to the website.
      - Are granular consent options provided?
        - Granular consent options are partially provided as users can choose between ""Required cookies"" and ""All Cookies,"" but they cannot select specific types of cookies (e.g., Analytics, Marketing).

  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
      - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined?
        - Third-party data sharing is mentioned but not explicitly detailed. It would be beneficial to provide more information about the parties with whom data is shared and the purpose of that sharing.
      - Are cross-border data transfers addressed?
        - No mention of cross-border data transfers is found in the provided text. GDPR requires entities to inform users about any transfer of their personal data outside the EU.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
      - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant
        - The policy does not clearly define the terms ""controller,"" ""processor,"" and ""third party."" This could lead to confusion about who is responsible for the data and its processing under GDPR.
      - Article 7: Partially Compliant
        - While the policy seeks user consent, it does not provide a clear and affirmative action for that consent, as required by Article 7(4). Additionally, the policy lacks transparency about the purpose of each cookie, which is also a requirement under this article.

  5. Final Justification:
      - The cookie policy is partially compliant with GDPR due to its failure to meet certain requirements, such as providing clear and affirmative consent mechanisms, outlining third-party data sharing, addressing cross-border data transfers, defining essential terms, and explaining the purpose of each cookie.

  6. Improvement Suggestions:
      - Revise the consent mechanism to ensure it meets the standard of a ""clear and affirmative action.""
      - Provide more information about third-party data sharing and cross-border data transfers.
      - Define essential terms such as ""controller,"" ""processor,"" and ""third party"" in the policy.
      - Explain the purpose of each cookie to ensure transparency under GDPR.
      - Revise the policy language to clearly communicate how users can withdraw their consent."

However, it does not specify which specific third parties are involved or where cross-border data transfers might occur.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? No, the policy does not address cross-border data transfers explicitly.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): The policy provides definitions of cookies which meet this requirement. However, it does not explicitly specify that personal data is collected via cookies, as required by Article 4(1).
   - Article 7: The policy allows users to give and withdraw consent for the use of cookies, but it does not clearly state that the processing of personal data using cookies is based on consent. Therefore, it could be argued that the policy is non-compliant with Article 7.

5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it provides granular options for users to manage their cookie preferences and allows them to withdraw consent easily. However, it lacks transparency regarding third-party data sharing and cross-border data transfers, and the language used in the policy could be improved to more explicitly state that processing of personal data using cookies is based on user consent.

6. Improvement Suggestions: To improve compliance with GDPR, the cookie policy should be updated to include explicit mention that the processing of personal data using cookies is based on user consent, as required by Article 7. Additionally, more specific information about third-party data sharing and cross-border data transfers should be provided in the policy. This could involve naming the relevant third parties involved or specifying the countries where cross-border data transfers occur.

      - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? No, there is no mention of cross-border data transfers or measures taken to ensure compliance with GDPR in such cases.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
      - Article 4(11): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The cookie policy does not define the terms ""controller"", ""processor"" and ""third party"" explicitly, but it does provide the necessary information to identify these entities (2B-Advice, .etracker.com, Cloudflare). However, a clear definition would improve readability and understanding for users.
      - Article 7: [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy provides information about the purpose of data processing (improving user experience), but it could be more compliant by explicitly stating that the processing is based on the user's consent. Additionally, it lacks a clear and concise explanation of how long the consent will be stored.
  5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it provides users with the option to give or withdraw consent, but there are areas that could be improved for clarity and transparency regarding data sharing and retention of consent.
  6. Improvement Suggestions:
      - Clearly state that the user's consent is given explicitly and knowingly.

However, it lacks clarity regarding explicit consent, granular options, data sharing transparency, and clear articulation of GDPR-specific requirements.

   2. Consent Mechanisms:
      - How is explicit consent handled?
        The policy allows users to explicitly consent by accepting cookies, but it does not specify whether the consent is explicit or implicit for each category of cookies. An explicit opt-in should be implemented for non-essential cookies.

      - Can users withdraw consent easily?

   3. Data Sharing Transparency:
      - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined?
        The policy mentions that marketing cookies can be set by advertising partners, indicating third-party data sharing. However, it does not provide clear details about the types of third parties involved or the purposes for which data is shared.

      - Are cross-border data transfers addressed?
        There is no mention of cross-border data transfers in the policy. It's important to clarify if personal data will be transferred outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the appropriate safeguards implemented.

   4. GDPR Article Compliance:
      - Article 4(11): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
        Not explicitly mentioned, but it's necessary to provide a clear and easily accessible privacy policy that explains how cookies are used, as required by this article.

      - Article 7: [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
        The policy provides some elements of informed consent, but explicit opt-in for non-essential cookies is not clearly implemented, which may make it difficult to demonstrate compliance with this article.

   5. Final Justification:
       The policy is partially compliant because it fails to meet the specific requirements outlined in GDPR articles 4(11) and 7, especially regarding explicit consent and granular options for users.

   - Article 4(11): The cookie policy explains the term 'personal data,' but it does not explain the concept of 'processing' separately, which is a non-compliant oversight (Reason: Article 4(2) clearly defines processing as any operation or set of operations performed on personal data).
   - Article 7: The policy provides information about the purposes for which data will be processed and offers the option to give or withdraw consent. However, the pre-ticked options in the 'Adjust' section may infringe upon users' ability to freely give and withdraw their consent (Reason: Pre-ticked options could suggest that consent is already given without active user involvement).

5. Final Justification: The policy provides some essential GDPR compliance elements but lacks clarity on a few points, such as explaining the concept of 'processing' separately and ensuring fully transparent consent mechanisms.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Clearly separate and explain the concept of 'processing' in the policy.
   - Avoid pre-ticking consent options and ensure users have a clear understanding that their consent is not automatically granted by navigating to the cookie policy or other pages on the site. Instead, make sure they actively opt-in to each category.
   - Explicitly address cross-border data transfers in the policy."

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - Explicit consent is handled through the acceptance of all cookies upon visiting the website or manually accepting them in the ""Cookie Settings"". However, it's not clear if this initial consent is explicit enough to meet GDPR requirements for granularity. Users can withdraw their consent by changing the settings, but there's no immediate 'deny' option at the beginning, which could be improved for more user-friendly experience.
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Third-party data sharing is outlined in the privacy settings, but it's not clear whether this includes cross-border data transfers.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant (The policy does not provide a clear and comprehensive description of cookies or similar technologies).
     - Article 7: Partially Compliant (Users are given the option to give consent, but the initial consent is not granular enough and there's no immediate 'deny' option for new visitors).
  5. Final Justification: The policy partially meets GDPR requirements by providing a way to manage cookie settings and giving users the opportunity to withdraw their consent. However, it fails to provide a clear description of cookies or explicit initial consent as required by GDPR.
  6. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Clarify the description of cookies in the policy to comply with Article 4(11).
     - Offer granular and immediate consent options upon visiting the website, including an 'Accept Essential Cookies Only' option.
     - Include a clear statement on cross-border data transfers if they occur."

   - The policy provides information about the use of cookies and consents, but it lacks specific details in some areas such as legal basis for processing and retention periods.

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
      - How is explicit consent handled? The cookie policy allows users to give explicit consent by selecting categories of cookies they agree to or by clicking on ""Accept all"". However, it does not clearly state whether the user's continued browsing on the website can be considered as implied consent for non-essential cookies.
      - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can change their cookie preferences at any time using the cookie settings button located at the bottom of the website.
      - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, users have the option to select specific categories of cookies they agree to use.

  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
      - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The policy mentions that Google Analytics, Microsoft Clarity, YouTube, and reCAPTCHA are used for tracking and analytics purposes. However, it does not provide a clear explanation of the purpose, recipients, or retention periods for this data sharing.
      - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? Yes, the policy states that users' data collected by these cookies/functions may be processed by Google/YouTube, Inc. in the USA and possibly other countries outside the EU. However, it does not provide information about appropriate safeguards for such data transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield certification.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
      - Article 4(11): [Non-Compliant] - The policy does not clearly define the ""controller"" and the ""processor"", which is a requirement under Article 4(11).
      - Article 7: [Partially Compliant] - The policy provides information about the use of cookies and consents, but it lacks specific details such as the legal basis for processing and retention periods.

  5. Final Justification: The cookie policy is partially compliant with GDPR due to its lack of clarity regarding the legal basis for processing, appropriate safeguards for cross-border data transfers, and defining the ""controller"" and the ""processor"".

  6. Improvement Suggestions: To ensure full compliance with GDPR, the following actionable steps can be taken:
      - Clearly define the controller and processor in the cookie policy.
      - Provide a clear legal basis for processing cookies and personal data under Article 6 of the GDPR.
      - Specify retention periods for cookies and personal data.
      - Include information about appropriate safeguards for cross-border data transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield certification.

   - The policy provides information about the use of cookies, the purpose, and the option to accept or reject them. However, it lacks a mechanism for obtaining explicit consent in line with GDPR requirements.

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled? (Non-Compliant): The policy does not provide a clear means of obtaining explicit and informed user consent as required by the GDPR.
     - Can users withdraw consent easily? (Partially Compliant): Users can withdraw their consent, but it is not made clear how this affects their experience on the site or whether they will continue to receive targeted advertising.
     - Are granular consent options provided? (Partially Compliant): The policy offers three categories of cookies, but does not provide a mechanism for users to accept or reject individual cookies, only entire categories.

  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? (Compliant): The policy mentions that functional and targeting cookies may be set by third parties, and users are informed of the potential transfer of data outside the EEA.
     - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? (Partially Compliant): The policy mentions potential data transfers outside the EEA, but does not provide information about the appropriate safeguards in place to protect data.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): [Non-Compliant + Reason]: There is no definition or description of the specific personal data and purposes for which the cookies are used as required by Article 4(11).
     - Article 7: [Non-Compliant + Reason]: The policy does not provide a clear, easily accessible means of obtaining explicit user consent in accordance with Article 7.

  5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it provides some information about cookies and the option to accept or reject them, but fails to meet the requirements for explicit, informed, and granular consent.

  6. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Implement a mechanism for obtaining explicit user consent that meets the requirements of Article 7. This could be done through a pop-up or banner with clear options to accept, reject, or manage preferences.
     - Provide more detailed information about the specific personal data collected, its purpose, and the legal basis for processing in accordance with Article 4(11).
     - Offer granular consent options by allowing users to accept or reject individual cookies rather than entire categories.
     - Clarify how users can withdraw their consent and the impact this will have on their experience on the site.
     - Address cross-border data transfers by providing information about the appropriate safeguards in place, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework."

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - Explicit consent is handled through the user's interaction with the cookie banner, but it could be improved by making sure that the consent is freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous.
     - Users can withdraw consent by revisiting the cookie settings and changing their preferences, however, a more accessible method for revoking consent should be provided (e.g., a user-friendly interface).
     - While granular options are offered to control certain categories of cookies, the level of detail could be increased to provide more transparency and control over individual cookies.
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Third-party data sharing is mentioned but not fully outlined, providing a clear and comprehensive description of which third parties receive data, for what purposes, and their locations would enhance compliance.
     - Cross-border data transfers are not addressed explicitly; it is essential to provide information about the transfer mechanisms in place to ensure compliance with GDPR.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): The policy does not clearly define ""personal data"" and ""processing,"" which may result in non-compliance if these terms are not accurately defined or explained.
     - Article 7: While the policy explains how and when consent is obtained, it could be improved by providing a clear explanation of the user's right to withdraw consent at any time. This would bring the policy into compliance with Article 7(3) of the GDPR.
  5. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR because it offers some level of control over cookies and mentions the importance of data privacy, but it lacks transparency in certain areas such as data sharing and specific GDPR requirements.
  6. Improvement Suggestions: To improve compliance, the following actionable steps can be taken:
     - Clearly define ""personal data"" and ""processing"" in the policy to meet Article 4(11) requirements.
     - Provide a more accessible method for users to revoke their consent.
     - Offer detailed information about third-party data sharing, including purposes and locations.

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - Explicit consent is handled through the user's agreement to cookies by clicking ""Accept All"". However, it could be argued that this may not meet the GDPR's standard for explicit consent as there seems to be no option to opt-in individually for each category of cookie. To improve compliance, offering a way to give separate consent for each type of cookie would be beneficial.
     - Users can withdraw consent by clicking ""Deny All"" or by adjusting their settings in the ""Individual Settings"" section. However, this functionality could be more prominent and user-friendly to ensure ease of withdrawal.
     - Granular consent options are provided in the ""Individual Settings"". Though, these granular options may not meet the strict GDPR requirements for specific cookie categories.
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Third-party data sharing is outlined through detailed descriptions under each cookie category in the policy text and individual settings.
     - Cross-border data transfers are not explicitly addressed in the provided text, which may be an area of improvement to ensure full compliance with GDPR regulations.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): The policy provides definitions for cookies and related technologies, demonstrating compliance with this article.
     - Article 7: While the mechanism for obtaining consent is present (through user agreement), it could be argued that explicit and informed consent is not fully achieved due to the lack of separate opt-in for each category of cookie.
  5. Final Justification: The policy partially meets GDPR requirements as it outlines the use of cookies, provides a mechanism for obtaining consent, offers a way to withdraw or adjust settings, and defines relevant terms. However, improvements are needed in terms of explicitly addressing cross-border data transfers and providing more granular options for consent regarding individual types of cookies.
  6. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Clearly state the policy's approach to cross-border data transfers, ensuring it complies with GDPR regulations.
     - Offer separate opt-in options for each category of cookie and make this process more user-friendly to ensure explicit and informed consent is obtained."

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - Explicit consent is handled through the user clicking ""Yes"" to agree to the use of cookies, which could be considered as explicit as it is a clear affirmative action.
   - Users can withdraw consent at any time by changing their cookie settings. However, blocking certain types of cookies may result in a compromised experience with the website and services provided.
   - Granular consent options are provided for different categories of cookies, such as required cookies, functional cookies, and marketing cookies. This allows users to control their preferences, but it could be argued that more granularity is needed for better transparency and user control.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Third-party data sharing is mentioned in the cookie policy, but it is not clearly outlined what specific data is shared with third parties or who these third parties are.
   - Cross-border data transfers are not addressed in this policy.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): The definition of consent provided in the cookie policy is not specific enough to meet the requirements of Article 4(11). Consent should be ""any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.""
   - Article 7: The cookie policy does not meet all the requirements of Article 7. The information provided to users about their consent is not easily accessible, specific, transparent, and concise. Also, it is not clear how long the consent will be stored, which is required by Article 7(2)(b).

5. Final Justification: The cookie policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it provides some level of transparency and allows users to control their preferences regarding cookies. However, it falls short in providing clear and specific information about data sharing with third parties, cross-border data transfers, and the duration of consent storage.

6. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance compliance, the following actionable steps can be taken:
   - Clearly outline what specific data is shared with third parties and who these third parties are in the cookie policy.
   - Address cross-border data transfers in the cookie policy.
   - Provide a more concise and easily accessible explanation of consent to users.
   - Specify how long the consent will be stored in the cookie policy.

       - Article 7: Non-Compliant (Reason): The policy doesn't provide a means to prove that clear and affirmative action has been obtained from the user for non-essential cookies, which is a requirement under GDPR Article 7.

   5. Final Justification: The Cookie Policy is partially compliant because it lacks explicit information about third-party data sharing, granular consent options, storage duration, and detailed explanations of purposes for each type of cookie.

   6. Improvement Suggestions:
       - Provide clear details about the purpose of each type of cookie, including their storage duration.
       - Explicitly mention any third-party data sharing in the policy and ensure GDPR-compliant mechanisms are in place for such data transfers.
       - Offer granular consent options for non-essential cookies, allowing users to accept or reject each category individually.

     - Article 7: Partially Compliant - Users are given the option to consent to the use of cookies, but they cannot choose specific categories of cookies to accept or reject.

5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR because it provides notice about the use of cookies and the ability for users to manage their preferences; however, it lacks granularity in consent options and does not clearly define personal data as required by Article 4(11).
6. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance compliance with GDPR, consider offering granular consent options that allow users to choose specific categories of cookies to accept or reject, provide a clear definition of personal data (as per Article 4(11)), and offer an option for easy withdrawal of consent for all cookies at once. Additionally, details about third-party data sharing and cross-border data transfers should be expanded upon to ensure full transparency."

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - Explicit consent is handled through users being informed about the use of cookies and given an option to accept or reject them, but there's no clear evidence that this consent is 'granular' in nature as it only provides two options (accept all or individual experiences with full control). Users can withdraw their consent by modifying their settings, but the ease of this process could be improved.
   - The policy mentions that users can revoke their consent, which suggests compliance with GDPR requirements for easy withdrawal of consent. However, more explicit instructions on how to do so would enhance user experience and comply more fully with GDPR guidelines.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Third-party data sharing is not explicitly outlined in the provided policy text, but it's mentioned that 'third-party providers' are involved. Further details about these parties, their purposes, and locations should be provided for full transparency.
   - Cross-border data transfers are not directly addressed, but since Porsche operates globally, it is likely that such transfers occur. Explicit mention of the measures taken to ensure compliance with GDPR for cross-border data transfers would strengthen the policy.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): The text does not clearly define or provide information about 'profiling' and its purposes, making it non-compliant with this article.
   - Article 7: Since explicit consent is obtained for the use of cookies but it is not clear that the user understands what they are consenting to (e.g., purpose of data processing, identities of third parties), the policy is non-compliant with Article 7.

5. Final Justification: The policy lacks clarity and specificity required by GDPR for user consent and transparency in data handling practices.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Revise the policy to provide granular consent options, clear explanations of data processing purposes (e.g., profiling), the identities of third-party providers involved, and details about cross-border data transfers and safeguards in place for such transfers. Also, include a simple and accessible way for users to withdraw their consent and manage their cookie settings at any time."

   - Explicit consent is obtained, but it could be improved by making the language clearer and more user-friendly. Users can withdraw their consent at any time by adjusting their preferences. Granular options for consent are provided, allowing users to accept or decline various categories of cookies.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Third-party data sharing is clearly outlined, with a mention of the potential processing of personal data in the USA and China. However, the policy should provide more specific details about the third parties involved and the purposes for which they process data. Cross-border data transfers are also addressed, but more information about the safeguards in place (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) would be beneficial.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): [Partially Compliant] - The policy provides a definition of personal data, but it does not explicitly mention the special categories of personal data as required by Article 9.
   - Article 7: [Non-Compliant] - While the policy allows users to give and withdraw their consent, the information provided about the processing operations does not meet the requirements for transparency under Article 12(1) and (2). More specific information should be provided about the purposes of the processing, the legal basis, and the retention periods.

5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it obtains consent and allows users to manage their preferences, but it lacks clarity in some areas and could provide more detailed information about data sharing with third parties and cross-border transfers.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Clarify the language used in the policy to make it more user-friendly and easily understandable.

   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? The policy mentions the use of Utiq technology and telecommunications network operator to create a unique identifier for recognizing users across services operated by third parties, which implies cross-border data transfers, but no explicit details about appropriate safeguards are provided.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
     The policy provides an explanation of the controllers, processors, and partners involved in data processing, making it compliant with Article 4(11).
   - Article 7: [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
     The policy offers users a choice and granular options to give their consent, which aligns with the requirements of Article 7. However, explicit information about the specific purpose for each type of data processing may be needed to ensure full compliance.

5. Final Justification:
   - The classification as Partially Compliant is due to the policy providing granular options for users to give their consent and allowing them to withdraw it easily. However, explicit information about the specific purpose for each type of data processing could strengthen its GDPR compliance.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance include providing more detailed explanations about the specific purposes for each type of data processing within the consent options to ensure transparency and clarity. Additionally, addressing cross-border data transfers with explicit information about appropriate safeguards could further improve the cookie policy's GDPR compliance."

Also, it's not clear whether the default settings meet the criteria for transparency and user control.

5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because while it provides options for users to give and withdraw consent, there are some areas that could be improved in terms of clarity and transparency regarding how data is processed and stored.

6. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance compliance, the following actionable steps could be considered:
   - Clearly stating default settings for tracking and non-tracking options to ensure transparency and user control
   - Ensuring that information presented is concise, easy to understand, and accessible to users before they give their consent
   - Explicitly addressing cross-border data transfers in the policy."

     - Users can withdraw consent by changing cookie settings. It is not explicitly stated that all data already collected before revoking consent will be deleted.
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Third-party data sharing is outlined, but the level of detail could be improved as it only refers users to the privacy policies of third-party providers for more information about their specific practices.
     - Cross-border data transfers are addressed, acknowledging that these may not offer a comparable level of data protection and access by third parties cannot be ruled out.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): The cookie policy does not clearly define the roles and responsibilities of joint controllers or processors for the processing activities described, only stating that Continental AG is the data controller (GDPR Art 4.7). [Non-Compliant]
     - Article 7: While users are given the option to consent to the use of cookies, it's not made clear whether such consent is specific, informed and unambiguous, as required by GDPR for legitimate processing of personal data. [Partially Compliant]

However, it does not clearly specify how the user's initial choice will be stored and whether this choice persists across sessions.
     - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users have the option to manage their cookie preferences or reject optional cookies at any time. The policy mentions that users can configure their browser to block even strictly necessary cookies, which may imply a way to withdraw consent. However, more explicit instructions for changing settings could be provided.
     - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, the policy allows users to manage their cookie preferences in individual categories.
3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The policy mentions that marketing cookies may be used to display advertisements on third-party websites but does not provide explicit details about the specific third parties involved or what data is shared with them.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? No, there is no mention of cross-border data transfers in the policy.
4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): The policy correctly defines cookies as a form of personal data but does not specify whether strictly necessary cookies are used only when they are strictly necessary or also for additional purposes that could be considered as profiling. This may make the policy Non-Compliant with Article 4(11).
   - Article 7: The policy provides information about the types of cookies used and their functions, clearly explains how to manage cookie preferences, and offers an option to withdraw consent. However, it does not explicitly state that consent is given by a clear and affirmative action (such as ticking a box) nor does it specify the period for which the consent is valid. This makes the policy Partially Compliant with Article 7.
5. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR regulations because it offers users options to manage their cookie preferences and withdraw consent, but lacks clarity in certain areas such as the scope of strictly necessary cookies and explicit consent mechanisms.
6. Improvement Suggestions: To improve compliance with GDPR, Knorr-Bremse could clarify the scope and purpose of strictly necessary cookies in Article 4(11), ensure that user consent is obtained through a clear and affirmative action (e.g., ticking a box), specify the period for which consent is valid, provide more explicit instructions on how to change cookie settings, and disclose information about third-party data sharing involved with marketing cookies."

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
      - Explicit consent is handled through the acceptance buttons provided, however, there's no clear indication that users are giving their ""explicit"" consent as per GDPR guidelines.
      - Users can withdraw consent by adjusting cookie settings, but it may not be immediately obvious to all users how to do this.
      - Granular consent options are provided for different categories of cookies (Necessary, Comfort, Statistics/Range Measurement).
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
      - Third-party data sharing with Google Analytics and YouTube Video is clearly outlined but the mention of Usercentrics Consent Management Platform doesn't provide enough information about their specific data processing activities.
      - Cross-border data transfers to the USA (Google Analytics) are mentioned, but no clear explanation or solution for potential risks due to insufficient level of data protection according to EU standards is provided.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
      - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant as there's no clear definition of 'controller' and 'processor'.
      - Article 7: Partially Compliant as users are given the option to consent, but explicit consent is not clearly defined or obtained.
  5. Final Justification: The policy provides some necessary information for cookie usage but lacks clarity on certain key GDPR requirements such as explicit consent and cross-border data transfer risks.
  6. Improvement Suggestions:
    - Clearly define 'controller' and 'processor' as required by Article 4(11) of the GDPR.
    - Simplify the language around user consent to ensure that it is explicitly obtained and easy to understand.
    - Provide more detailed information about data sharing with third parties like Usercentrics, including their specific data processing activities.
    - Address potential risks associated with cross-border data transfers to the USA (Google Analytics) by implementing appropriate safeguards such as standard contractual clauses or the use of Privacy Shield certified companies."
advanced_explanation,non_compliant,non_compliant-45.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant
   - The policy provides information about the use of cookies and data sharing with third parties, but it lacks some essential details required by GDPR for full compliance.

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled?
       - The website offers three options for cookie consent: Allow all cookies, Allow selection, Use necessary cookies only. This mechanism could be considered as providing explicit consent. However, it's not clear whether users have actually provided their consent explicitly or implicitly (e.g., by continuing to use the site).
     - Can users withdraw consent easily?
       - The policy does not provide an easy way for users to withdraw their consent after it has been given. A clear and accessible opt-out mechanism should be implemented to allow users to revoke their consent at any time.
     - Are granular consent options provided?
       - Yes, the policy offers a reasonable level of granularity by allowing users to select which categories of cookies they want to accept (Necessary, Preferences, Statistics, Marketing).

  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined?
       - The policy mentions the sharing of data with social media, advertising, and analytics partners but does not specify which specific third parties are involved or what kind of data is being shared. More clarity is needed to meet GDPR requirements for transparency.
     - Are cross-border data transfers addressed?
       - No, there is no mention of cross-border data transfers in the policy, although it might be assumed that some third parties are based outside the EU given the use of terms like 'partners.' However, this assumption should be confirmed to ensure compliance with GDPR rules on international data transfers.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
       - The policy does not explicitly define 'cookie' in the manner specified by Article 4(11) of GDPR, but it is generally understood that the term 'cookie' is widely used and commonly accepted. Therefore, this point can be considered as compliant with some qualifications.
     - Article 7: [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
       - The policy does not fully comply with Article 7 of GDPR because the mechanism for obtaining and recording user consent is not sufficiently transparent or accessible, and there is no easy way for users to withdraw their consent after it has been given.

  5. Final Justification:
     - The website's cookie policy partially complies with GDPR due to the lack of clarity in certain areas such as data sharing with third parties and user consent withdrawal options.

  6. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance include providing more specific information about third-party data sharing, implementing a clear and accessible opt-out mechanism for users to withdraw their consent, and ensuring that the method of obtaining and recording user consent is transparent and compliant with GDPR requirements. Additionally, it would be helpful to update the policy to explicitly define 'cookie' as specified in Article 4(11) of GDPR."

     - How is explicit consent handled? The website provides users with the option to give or withdraw consent and offers granular control over which cookies they allow. However, it does not explicitly state the legal basis for processing data beyond obtaining consent.
     - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can easily withdraw their consent by changing their preferences in the Privacy Preference Center at any time.
     - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, users are given the option to enable or disable different categories of cookies (Necessary, Performance, Marketing).

  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The policy mentions several third-party services that collect and process user data but does not provide clear information about the purposes of the processing or the types of data being shared.
     - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? The policy mentions data transfers to countries outside the EU without an adequate level of data protection, but it does not explicitly state the legal basis for such transfers or any safeguards in place to protect user data.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): [Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy does not provide a clear and concise definition of personal data, which is required by Article 4(11).
     - Article 7: [Partially Compliant + Reason] The policy provides users with the ability to give or withdraw consent but does not explicitly state the legal basis for processing data beyond obtaining consent, as required by Article 7.

  5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it provides users with information about cookies and the option to give or withdraw consent, but it lacks transparency in explaining the legal basis for processing data and the purposes of third-party data sharing.

  6. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance:
        1. Explicitly state the legal basis for processing personal data beyond obtaining consent, such as contractual necessity or legitimate interests.
        2. Provide clear and concise definitions of personal data in line with Article 4(11).
        3. Clearly outline the purposes of third-party data sharing, including the types of data being shared and the legal basis for such transfers.
        4. If data is transferred to countries outside the EU without an adequate level of data protection, provide information about any safeguards in place to protect user data, such as standard contractual clauses or binding corporate rules."

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled? The cookie policy provides an option for users to either agree or deny the use of cookies and similar technologies. However, it would be more compliant if a clear explanation of what data will be collected and processed is provided before the user gives their consent.
     - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can modify their settings or withdraw consent at any time through the ""Cookie settings"" link in the footer of the website. This is commendable.
     - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, users are given the option to choose between categories such as Marketing & Analytics and Essential. However, more granular options could be offered to give users more control over their data.
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The cookie policy does list several third-party services that use cookies and similar technologies, but a clear explanation of how the data will be shared between these parties is not provided.
     - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? There is no mention of cross-border data transfers in the policy. It would be necessary to address this issue as it may impact GDPR compliance.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The cookie policy does explain the purpose of processing personal data, which is in line with Article 4(11). However, more detail about the specific legal basis for processing should be provided.
     - Article 7: [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The cookie policy provides a method for obtaining consent to process personal data (through the ""Cookie settings"" option), but it could be more compliant if a clear and concise explanation of the processing is given before users give their consent.
  5. Final Justification: The main reason for the ""Partially Compliant"" classification is that while the cookie policy does offer an option to consent or deny the use of cookies, it could be more explicit about the data being collected and processed, and the legal basis for this processing. It also lacks clarity on third-party data sharing and cross-border data transfers.
  6. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance compliance with GDPR, the cookie policy should provide a clear explanation of what data will be collected, how it will be used, and the legal basis for this processing before users give their consent. It should also clearly outline third-party data sharing practices and address cross-border data transfers. Additionally, more granular options could be offered to give users greater control over their data."

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides a mechanism for users to give their consent, but it's not entirely clear whether the given consent is explicit as per GDPR guidelines.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily? The policy does not provide an option for users to withdraw their consent easily.
   - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, the policy offers three levels of consent: accepting only essential cookies, accepting all cookies except essential ones, and saving and closing the cookie banner without giving any consent. However, it doesn't allow users to accept or reject specific types of cookies individually.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? No, the policy does not provide clear information about third-party data sharing.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? There is no mention of cross-border data transfers in the policy.

   - Article 7: Partially Compliant + Reason: While the policy provides an option for users to give their consent, it does not meet all the requirements of Article 7 (e.g., providing information about the purpose of processing, retention periods, and the identity of the data controller).

5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR because it offers some level of transparency, provides options for users to give their consent, but lacks clarity on certain key aspects such as third-party data sharing, cross-border data transfers, and granular control over the types of cookies accepted.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance:
     - Clearly define terms used in the policy to ensure understanding by users.

     - Users can withdraw consent easily by changing their settings in the Privacy Settings at the bottom of the website.
     - Granular consent options are provided, but the language could be more user-friendly and explicit about what each option entails.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Third-party data sharing is outlined, including a list of data processing providers (IAB TCF Providers and Non-IAB TCF Providers). However, it would be beneficial to provide clear explanations about the purposes for which third-party vendors use this data.
   - Cross-border data transfers are not explicitly addressed in the policy text provided.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): The policy does not define the terms ""controller"" and ""processor"", so it is Non-Compliant regarding this specific point (Reason: Definitions must be provided to meet Article 4(11) requirements).
   - Article 7: Since explicit consent is handled and users can withdraw their consent easily, it appears Compliant (Reason: The policy provides the means for users to actively and freely give and revoke consent, which aligns with Article 7).

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant + Reason: The policy does not provide a clear and comprehensive description of what constitutes a ""cookie"" in accordance with GDPR's definition.
   - Article 7: Partially Compliant + Reason: While the policy provides an option for users to consent or reject cookies, it does not offer a means for users to withdraw their consent easily at any time in line with Article 7(3) GDPR. Also, the policy could do more to ensure that the consent is specific, informed, and unambiguous.
5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it provides options for user consent but lacks clarity on certain aspects such as third-party data sharing and cross-border data transfers, and it does not fully adhere to Article 4(11) and Article 7 requirements of GDPR.

   - The cookie policy provides some necessary information and offers options to manage cookie settings, but it lacks clarity in certain areas like data retention periods and the legal basis for processing cookies.

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled?
     - Explicit consent is provided through the ""Accept & Close"" option, which accepts all processing, or the ""Deny"" option, which allows only functional cookies. However, it's not explicitly stated if users are required to actively accept non-essential cookies (Marketing and Functional) as per GDPR requirements.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily?
     - Yes, users can easily manage their preferences at any time by clicking on ""Cookie Settings.""
   - Are granular consent options provided?
     - Yes, the policy offers granular control over cookie categories (Essential, Functional, and Marketing). However, users are not informed about the specific purposes for each category.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined?
     - Yes, third-party data sharing is outlined under ""Data Processing Providers & Services"" in the Cookie Settings.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed?
     - No, cross-border data transfers are not explicitly addressed in the policy.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
     - Compliant - The policy defines personal data as per Article 4(1).
   - Article 7: [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
     - Non-Compliant - While the policy offers the option to manage cookie settings, it does not provide a clear and comprehensive description of the processing operations or the legal basis for the processing, as required by Article 7(4) GDPR.

5. Final Justification:
   - The classification is Partially Compliant because while the policy provides some necessary information and offers options to manage cookie settings, it lacks clarity in certain areas like data retention periods, legal basis for processing cookies, and addressing cross-border data transfers as per GDPR requirements.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance:
     - Clearly state the legal basis for processing cookies in the policy (e.g., legitimate interest, consent).
     - Provide detailed descriptions of the purposes and specific processing activities related to each cookie category (Essential, Functional, and Marketing).
     - Specify data retention periods for different types of cookies.
     - Explicitly address cross-border data transfers, including any safeguards in place (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses).
     - Ensure that users are clearly informed about their right to withdraw consent and how to do so."

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled? Users are provided with clear options to accept or reject cookies, and they can also customize their preferences. However, the information about data processing in the USA under Art. 49 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a GDPR is not displayed at the point of consent but rather in the Cookie Policy, which may be considered non-transparent.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can access their cookie settings at any time via the Cookie Policy and revoke their consent.
   - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, users can select which non-essential cookies to accept or decline.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The types of cookies used are briefly explained (Strictly Necessary, Performance, Functional, Targeting), but it is not explicitly stated whether these cookies are first-party or third-party cookies.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? Yes, the policy mentions that users agree under Art. 49 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a GDPR that their data may be processed in the USA, acknowledging the risk of US authorities accessing user data for monitoring purposes without legal redress.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): The policy does not specify whether or how pseudonymization is applied, so it cannot be determined if they are compliant with this article.
   - Article 7: The policy provides users with clear and concise information about the use of cookies, offers granular consent options, and allows users to withdraw their consent easily, making it partially compliant with Article 7. However, the information about data processing in the USA is not displayed at the point of consent, which may violate transparency requirements under Article 7(1).

5. Final Justification: The policy is only partially compliant because it does not fully meet the GDPR's transparency requirement for informing users about data processing in the USA at the point of consent.

6. Improvement Suggestions: To improve compliance, the following steps can be taken:
   - Display information about data processing in the USA at the point of consent to ensure transparency under Article 7(1).
   - Clearly state whether the cookies are first-party or third-party cookies.
   - If possible, provide more details on how pseudonymization is applied to ensure compliance with Article 4(11)."
advanced_explanation,partially-compliant,partially_compliant_12.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - Explicit consent is handled via the user's active selection of cookie preferences. However, it could be improved by making the purpose of each type of cookie clearer to enhance user understanding.
   - Users can easily withdraw consent by changing their cookie settings at any time.
   - Granular consent options are provided with the ability to select essential cookies only, functional cookies, or advertising cookies.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Third-party data sharing is outlined in the policy but could be made clearer by providing specific details about the third parties involved and the purpose of the data sharing.
   - Cross-border data transfers are not explicitly addressed. It would be beneficial to include information regarding any cross-border data transfers and compliance with appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): The policy provides a definition of cookies, but it could be improved by explicitly stating that cookies are personal data under the GDPR (as they can identify a natural person). [Non-Compliant]
   - Article 7: The policy provides a means for users to give and withdraw their consent. However, it could be improved by making the information about each type of cookie clearer and more easily understandable for the average user. [Partially Compliant]

5. Final Justification:
The main reason for the ""Partially Compliant"" classification is that while the policy provides a means for users to give and withdraw their consent, it could be improved in terms of transparency and clarity regarding data sharing, third-party involvement, and the nature of cookies as personal data under GDPR.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Enhance the user experience by providing clearer explanations about the purpose of each type of cookie (e.g., required, functional, advertising) to help users make informed decisions.
   - Make explicit that cookies are personal data under GDPR and include information regarding cross-border data transfers and the appropriate safeguards in place for such transfers.
   - Revise the policy's language to ensure it is easily understood by the average user, promoting transparency and building trust with visitors."

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - Explicit consent is handled through the cookie banner where users must actively accept cookies to proceed with the website. Users can withdraw their consent by changing settings in the ""Settings"" section. However, granular consent options are provided only for Deutsche Telekom AG's analytics and marketing purposes, while third-party data sharing (marketing through partners) is bundled under a single setting that requires user consent.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Third-party data sharing with major partners (excluding some minor ones) is clearly outlined in the policy. Cross-border data transfers are addressed, but it may not be immediately clear to users that their data might not have the same level of protection as in the European Union due to Article 49 (1) a GDPR.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): The policy mentions cookies and similar technologies, which are defined under Article 4(11), making it Compliant with this article.
   - Article 7: Since users can freely give and withdraw their consent, the cookie policy is generally in line with Article 7. However, users cannot refuse third-party cookies as they are bundled with Deutsche Telekom AG's cookies. This could be seen as a violation of users' right to separate consent under Article 7(4).

5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because while it provides necessary information and allows users to give and withdraw their consent, it does not offer a truly granular approach for third-party data sharing.

6. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance compliance, Deutsche Telekom AG can separate the options for third-party cookies (marketing through partners) from its own analytics and marketing purposes. This will allow users to give or refuse consent independently, in accordance with Article 7(4). Additionally, it would be beneficial to clarify cross-border data transfer implications more explicitly for users."
advanced_explanation,partially-compliant,partially_compliant_14.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - Explicit consent is handled by requiring users to accept cookies and tracking services via a clear consent banner. However, the ""Accept All"" option does not seem granular enough as it grants full consent to all types of cookies without differentiating between necessary, analytics, marketing, and personalization cookies.
     - Users can withdraw their consent by adjusting settings in the Cookie Settings section. This is compliant with GDPR requirements for easy withdrawal of consent.
     - Granular options are provided, but the ""Accept All"" option does not fully meet this requirement as it doesn't allow users to control specific categories of cookies individually.
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Third-party data sharing is outlined in the Cookie Settings section for marketing and social networks, but no mention is made about cross-border data transfers or other potential partners. This needs improvement for full compliance with GDPR.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): The policy mentions cookies and similar technologies that store information on users' devices. However, it does not explicitly refer to ""cookies"" as a method for storing or accessing information on the user's device, which may be non-compliant with this article.
     - Article 7: Explicit consent is sought from users before setting cookies and tracking services, which aligns with GDPR requirements. However, the ""Accept All"" option does not provide granular control over different categories of cookies as required by Article 7(4).
  5. Final Justification: The policy only partially complies with GDPR due to the lack of clear communication regarding third-party data sharing and cross-border transfers, the need for a more granular ""Accept All"" option, and potential issues with the interpretation of Article 4(11).
  6. Improvement Suggestions: To improve compliance with GDPR, Vodafone should make the following changes:
     - Clearly outline third-party data sharing partners and cross-border transfers in the cookie policy.
     - Modify the ""Accept All"" option to grant consent on a per-category basis (e.g., necessary, analytics, marketing, personalization).
     - Ensure the interpretation of Article 4(11) is clarified to explicitly refer to cookies as a method for storing or accessing information on the user's device."
advanced_explanation,partially-compliant,partially_compliant_15.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - Explicit consent is handled through the ""Accept All Cookies"" button and the ""Cookie Settings."" However, users are not prompted to give their consent upon first visit which is a GDPR requirement. The option to withdraw consent is present but not easily noticeable as it's located in the ""Cookie Settings."" Granular consent options are provided in the ""Cookie Settings,"" although they could be more prominent for better user understanding.
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Third-party data sharing is not explicitly outlined in the policy text, but it is addressed in the ""Cookie Settings"" under the ""Targeting Cookies"" category. Cross-border data transfers are not mentioned.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): The policy does not clearly define ""controller,"" ""processor,"" and ""third party"" as required by this article, making it Non-Compliant.
     - Article 7: While the policy provides an option to accept or reject cookies, it does not meet all of the requirements for valid consent under Article 7 (2) such as giving users informed and unambiguous consent and providing the ability to withdraw that consent easily which makes it Non-Compliant.
  5. Final Justification: The policy is Partially Compliant because while it offers granular cookie preferences, it lacks compliance with specific GDPR requirements like explicit and informed consent upon first visit, clear explanation of data sharing practices, and proper definitions for GDPR terms.
  6. Improvement Suggestions:
    - Prompt users to give their explicit consent upon first visit.
    - Clearly outline third-party data sharing practices in the policy text and explain cross-border data transfers.
    - Define ""controller,"" ""processor,"" and ""third party"" as per GDPR Article 4(11) within the policy.
    - Simplify the process of withdrawing consent by making it more noticeable and easy to use.
    - Update the design of the cookie banner to comply with the GDPR requirements for valid consent, including providing a clear explanation of why and how cookies are used."

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides an option for users to explicitly grant or deny consent by choosing among the three provided options. However, it lacks a mechanism to ensure that the user has actually read and understood the information related to each type of cookie.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can change their preferences at any time by clicking on the ""Cookie Settings"" option.
   - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, users are offered three distinct options to customize their consent preferences.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? Yes, the policy explicitly mentions that marketing cookies involve third-party data sharing with LinkedIn USA and other potential data processors located in the EU, USA, India, and UK.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? Yes, the policy provides information about cross-border data transfers, but it does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure compliance with GDPR requirements for such transfers.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): [Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy does not provide a clear and comprehensive definition of the terms ""controller"", ""processor"", and ""third party"" as required by Article 4(11).
   - Article 7: [Partially Compliant + Reason] While the policy offers users the option to grant or deny consent, it lacks mechanisms to ensure that the user has been informed of each purpose for data processing in a concise, transparent, and easily accessible form (as per Article 7(1)).

5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR due to its lack of clarity regarding the definitions of key terms and insufficient information provided about cross-border data transfers and the purposes of data processing.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance could include providing more detailed information about each type of cookie, ensuring that users are presented with a clear and concise summary of the purposes of data processing before consent is sought, offering a mechanism to ensure users have read and understood this information, and including a clear definition of key terms as per Article 4(11)."

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides two options for users to give explicit consent, accepting all cookies or only necessary cookies. However, the functional and targeting cookies are set by default (off), which means that they don't require active user consent when visiting the site for the first time. This may not meet the GDPR standard of requiring explicit consent for non-essential cookies.
     - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can change their cookie preferences at any time using the ""Cookie Settings"" option.
     - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, users have a choice to accept all cookies, only necessary cookies, or customize their preferences. However, default settings for some cookies may not meet the GDPR standard of requiring explicit consent.
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The policy mentions that cookies are used for anonymous statistics and personalized content, but it does not explicitly state if these involve third-party data sharing. More clarity is needed in this area.
     - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? No, there is no mention of cross-border data transfers in the provided policy. This needs to be addressed as GDPR requires that controllers ensure they have appropriate safeguards in place for such transfers.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant (Reason: The policy does not clearly define what a 'cookie' is and the various types of cookies used by the website.)
     - Article 7: Partially Compliant (Reason: Users have options to give explicit consent, but the default settings for some cookies may not meet the GDPR standard.)
  5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with the GDPR as it provides options for users to manage their cookie preferences and offers a way to withdraw consent. However, it falls short in terms of providing clear information about third-party data sharing and cross-border data transfers, and in ensuring that all non-essential cookies require explicit user consent.
  6. Improvement Suggestions: To improve compliance with the GDPR, the following steps can be taken:
     - Clearly define what a 'cookie' is and provide detailed information about the various types of cookies used by the website.
     - Ensure that all non-essential cookies require explicit user consent and do not have default settings.
     - Explicitly state any third-party data sharing practices related to cookies in the policy.

   - While the cookie policy provides a choice for users to accept or reject cookies, it does not offer granular consent options for each type of cookie as required by GDPR.

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - Explicit consent is handled through the cookie banner and users can choose from three options: Accept All, Only Technically Necessary, or Settings. However, users cannot give granular consent to different types of cookies separately.
   - Users can withdraw consent by changing their settings, but this does not seem to be as simple and prominent as the initial acceptance process.
   - Granular consent options are not provided.

  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Third-party data sharing is outlined in the cookie policy, mentioning partners such as Google.
   - Cross-border data transfers are not explicitly addressed in the given text.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): The policy does not appear to provide clear definitions of terms used that are essential to understand the processing activities, making it Non-Compliant according to GDPR requirements.
   - Article 7: While users are given a choice to accept or reject cookies, they are not provided with clear information about what each category of cookie is for and how their data will be used, which can make it difficult for users to give informed consent. This makes the policy Non-Compliant according to GDPR requirements.

  5. Final Justification:
   - The classification is Partially Compliant because the policy offers a choice to users but lacks granular consent options and does not provide clear, concise information about each category of cookie and how user data will be used, which are necessary elements for GDPR compliance.

  6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To enhance compliance with GDPR, the following steps can be taken:
     - Provide granular consent options, allowing users to accept or reject different categories of cookies separately.
     - Offer more detailed information about each category of cookie and how user data will be used in a clear and concise manner.

     - Users can withdraw consent easily via the ""Review and change your consent"" button on the Cookie Policy page. This is compliant.
     - Granular consent options are provided in the cookie settings, allowing users to choose which categories of cookies they accept. However, more information about marketing cookies could be provided to ensure transparency.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Third-party data sharing is outlined, but it would be beneficial to provide specific details about the third parties with whom data may be shared and for what purposes.
   - Cross-border data transfers are not explicitly addressed. The policy should clarify whether the company uses servers or processes data outside of the EU and if so, what measures are in place to ensure compliance with GDPR.

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides an option for users to accept or decline cookies, which can be considered as a form of consent. However, it's not clear if the initial presentation of the cookie banner is sufficient to meet the GDPR standard of ""clear and affirmative action"" for obtaining user consent.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily? Users are given the option to change their settings at any time by visiting ""My Account"", the Cookie Notice, or the Interest-Based Advertising Notice, which can be considered as a mechanism to withdraw consent.
   - Are granular consent options provided? The policy offers three main options: Accept All, Reject Everything, and Technically Necessary Cookies. While this provides some level of granularity, it doesn't seem to offer the detailed, granular choices required by GDPR for non-essential cookies.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The policy mentions that 96 third-party providers use cookies on the service, but it doesn't specify which parties these are or what specific data is shared with them. This could be improved to provide clearer transparency.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? There is no explicit mention of cross-border data transfers in the policy. However, given Amazon's global operations, it's important that this aspect is clearly outlined.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): The policy does not explicitly state whether or not it complies with this article (definitions of personal data and processing), but the use of cookies and collection of user data suggests potential compliance.
   - Article 7: The policy provides mechanisms for obtaining consent, but it's not clear if the initial presentation of the cookie banner is sufficient to meet the GDPR standard of a ""clear and affirmative act"" for obtaining user consent. Therefore, it can be considered as potentially non-compliant with this article.

5. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR due to some uncertainties regarding explicit consent, granularity in consent options, third-party data sharing transparency, and cross-border data transfer clarification.

6. Improvement Suggestions: To improve compliance, Amazon could consider the following steps:
   - Clearly explain the initial cookie banner presentation to ensure it meets the GDPR standard of a ""clear and affirmative act"" for obtaining user consent.
   - Provide more granular options in the consent mechanism, allowing users to choose which specific types of cookies they accept or reject.
   - Clearly outline third-party data sharing partners and what specific data is shared with them.
   - Explicitly address cross-border data transfers in the policy.

     - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, users have the option to configure individual preferences by clicking on ""More"" and selecting functional, statistics, or marketing cookies.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The policy lists various third-party services using cookies (e.g., Adobe Analytics, Google Ads, HubSpot, etc.).
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? There's no explicit mention of addressing cross-border data transfers, but GDPR guidelines suggest that businesses should inform users about the potential international transfer of their personal data.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant (Reason: The definition of ""personal data"" in Article 4(11) includes any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. Although the cookie policy refers to personal settings, it should also make clear that cookies may collect IP addresses, which can be considered personal data under GDPR.)
   - Article 7: Compliant (Reason: The policy provides a clear, concise, and accessible form to obtain explicit consent from users for cookie usage in accordance with Article 7.)

5. Final Justification: Although the cookie policy outlines various privacy preferences and offers granular control to users, it is still considered partially compliant due to missing clarifications about cross-border data transfers and the potential classification of IP addresses as personal data under GDPR.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance:
     - Clearly indicate if cookies may collect IP addresses, which are considered personal data under GDPR.

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - Explicit consent is handled through the use of a cookie policy and the provision of two options: ""Edit or Decline"" for granular control, and ""Accept Basic Only"" for full consent. Users can withdraw consent by managing their privacy settings. However, it would be more user-friendly to provide clear explanations alongside each option, rather than requiring users to click through to learn more.
     - Withdrawal of consent is possible, but the process could be simplified and made more visible.
     - Granular consent options are provided for functional, marketing & advertising, optional features cookies.
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Third-party data sharing is clearly outlined in the cookie policy.
     - Cross-border data transfers are addressed by mentioning that user data may be transferred outside the EU/EEA (e.g., USA).
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): The definition of ""personal data"" and ""processing"" is not explicitly mentioned, but they are indirectly referenced in the policy (e.g., IP addresses, browsing behavior).
     - Article 7: While explicit consent is sought, it is not evident that it is specific, informed, and unambiguous as required by GDPR because users must click through to learn more about each option before making a decision.

5. Final Justification: The policy provides a basic level of transparency regarding data processing and third-party data sharing, but the process for giving and withdrawing consent could be improved to ensure it is specific, informed, and unambiguous as required by GDPR.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Update the cookie policy to provide clear explanations alongside each consent option so that users can easily understand what they are agreeing to when making a choice.
   - Simplify the process for withdrawing consent and make it more visible within the user interface.

Cookies are small files that are downloaded by a web browser when you visit a website for the first time, which help improve the user experience by remembering your preferences and settings. The text discusses different types of cookies:

1. First-party cookies: These are placed on the website by the site owner or their service providers.
2. Third-party cookies: These are placed on the website by third-party providers, such as advertisers or analytics companies.

The author explains that some cookies require consent to be placed, and you can manage your cookie settings via features on the website or through changing your browser settings. It's important to note that if you reject all cookies, you may not fully benefit from certain features on the website, and in some cases, you may not have access to all content.

    While the cookie policy provides information about the use of cookies and offers users control over their preferences, it lacks certain specific details required by GDPR for full compliance.

   2. Consent Mechanisms:
       - How is explicit consent handled?
           The policy mentions that consent is required for marketing, analytics, and personalization purposes. However, it does not specify whether the initial consent is obtained through an active opt-in or a default acceptance through continued browsing (passive). This needs to be clarified.
       - Can users withdraw consent easily?
           The user can revoke their consent at any time in the Cookie Manager. This is acceptable as long as it is easy to find and use.
       - Are granular consent options provided?
           The policy offers two main categories: required cookies and all other cookies (analytics, personalization, marketing). However, users are given the option to accept or reject all other cookies without being able to choose individual types of cookies. This could be improved by offering more granular control over cookie settings.

   3. Data Sharing Transparency:
       - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined?
           The policy mentions that a third party is used for processing marketing data, but it does not specify all the third parties involved in data collection, processing, or storage. It should be made clear which specific partners are used for each purpose (e.g., analytics providers).
       - Are cross-border data transfers addressed?
           The policy does not explicitly mention cross-border data transfers. As GDPR requires that appropriate safeguards be in place for such transfers, this needs to be clarified in the policy.

   4. GDPR Article Compliance:
       - Article 4(11): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
           The term ""personal data"" is defined but not all the concepts listed under Article 4(11) are explicitly mentioned, thus it could be improved.
       - Article 7: [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
           While the policy states that consent is required for marketing purposes and users can revoke their consent, it does not clearly specify that the consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous, as required by GDPR. The mechanism for obtaining initial consent should be revised to ensure compliance with Article 7.

   5. Final Justification:
       The cookie policy is partially compliant because it provides information about cookies and offers users control over their preferences, but lacks specific details on third-party data sharing and cross-border data transfers, as well as not meeting all requirements for consent under GDPR.

   6. Improvement Suggestions:
       - Clarify the initial consent mechanism to ensure it meets the requirements of Article 7.
       - Offer more granular control over cookie settings to users.
       - Explicitly list all third parties involved in data collection, processing, or storage.
       - Address cross-border data transfers and specify any appropriate safeguards used.
       - Revise the policy to include all concepts listed under Article 4(11) of GDPR."

     - The cookie policy provides information about the types of cookies used, their purposes, and how they can be managed or blocked. However, it does not provide clear and comprehensive details on data retention periods, cookie lifespans, or the specific legal basis for processing certain types of cookies (e.g., performance, functional, social media, personalization).

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled? The policy mentions that users can choose not to allow some types of cookies but does not explicitly state that it requires explicit consent for non-essential cookies. However, the ability to manage cookie preferences suggests an opt-in approach.
     - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can change their cookie preferences at any time through the provided controls.
     - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, the policy offers granular control over different categories of cookies, allowing users to make informed choices about the data they allow to be collected and processed.

  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The policy mentions that functional, social media, and personalization cookies may be set by third-party providers whose services have been added to the site. However, it does not specify whether or how these third parties might share user data with other organizations.
     - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? No, the policy does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure compliance with GDPR regulations regarding cross-border data transfers.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant - The policy does not provide a clear and comprehensive definition of personal data, nor does it explicitly state the controller's contact details.
     - Article 7: Partially Compliant - While users are offered the ability to manage their cookie preferences and give or withdraw consent, the policy could be more explicit in stating that this constitutes an opt-in approach and providing clear information on the legal basis for processing certain types of cookies.

  5. Final Justification: The website's cookie policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it offers users control over their cookie preferences and some transparency regarding data collection and processing. However, it lacks clarity in defining personal data, providing detailed information on data retention periods, and addressing cross-border data transfers.

  6. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Update the policy to explicitly state that it requires explicit consent for non-essential cookies and provide clear information on the legal basis for processing different types of cookies.
     - Clearly define personal data in accordance with GDPR Article 4(1) and provide the controller's contact details as required by Article 4(11).
     - Include detailed information on data retention periods, cookie lifespans, and any measures taken to ensure compliance with GDPR regulations regarding cross-border data transfers.
     - Consider offering additional options for users to manage their preferences at a more granular level (e.g., allowing users to control the expiry dates of cookies or choosing which third parties can set cookies on their browser)."

2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides a clear mechanism for users to give explicit consent by allowing them to choose which categories of cookies they want to allow. However, the default setting is to accept all cookies, which may not be considered fully compliant as it doesn't require active consent from the user initially.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can change their cookie preferences at any time by clicking on the ""Necessary cookies only"" or ""Accept all"" buttons, indicating they can revoke their consent.
   - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, the policy offers granular consent options as users can select specific categories of cookies they want to allow or deny.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? Yes, the policy provides detailed information about each third-party cookie used (e.g., etracker.com, .aws...), including their purpose and lifespan. However, cross-border data transfers are not explicitly mentioned.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? No, there is no clear mention of cross-border data transfers in the policy text. This should be included to ensure full GDPR compliance.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): The policy does not provide a clear definition of ""controller"" and ""processor,"" which is required under this article for transparency purposes. [Non-Compliant]
   - Article 7: The policy provides a mechanism for users to give and withdraw consent, although the initial default setting may not be fully compliant. However, it does offer granular options for consent, which can be considered compliant with Article 7 under certain conditions. [Partially Compliant]

5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant as it offers granular consent options and allows users to withdraw their consent. However, it fails to explicitly address cross-border data transfers and lacks a clear definition of ""controller"" and ""processor.""

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance:
     - Clearly define the roles of controller and processor as per Article 4(11).
     - Clarify the initial consent mechanism to require active consent from users rather than accepting all cookies by default.
     - Explicitly address cross-border data transfers in the policy.
     - Consider including a link or information about users' rights under GDPR, such as the right to access, delete, and port their data."

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - Explicit consent is handled by the user clicking ""Accept all"" to store cookies on their device, and the option to reject all but necessary cookies is also provided. However, granular control over the type of cookies that are accepted (e.g., strictly necessary, performance, marketing) is available within the cookie settings, but it's not explicit at first glance when users land on the page.
     - Users can withdraw consent by changing their preferences in the cookie settings, which is accessible via the link provided. However, the option for easy and immediate withdrawal of consent might be improved.
     - While granular control options are provided within the cookie settings, it could be argued that these should be more clearly visible upon landing on the page to comply with GDPR's requirement for clear and informed consent.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Third-party data sharing is outlined by categorizing cookies as those set by advertising partners, but cross-border data transfers are not explicitly addressed.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): The policy does not provide a comprehensive definition of the terms used (e.g., personal data, processing), which could lead to non-compliance if these terms are not defined in line with GDPR's requirements.
   - Article 7: While users are provided with the opportunity to give and withdraw consent, it is not always as easy as required by GDPR. For example, more explicit options for giving consent upon landing on the page could be implemented, and the process for withdrawing consent should be streamlined.

5. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR due to its provision of an option to reject all but necessary cookies, granular control within cookie settings, and a link to further information about cookies. However, it falls short in terms of explicitness regarding the types of cookies, data transfers, and definitions of GDPR terms.

6. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance compliance, the following actionable steps could be considered:
   - Make granular control options more visible upon landing on the page, such as by providing separate buttons for different categories of cookies.
   - Clearly outline third-party data sharing and cross-border data transfers in the policy.
   - Define terms used in the policy (e.g., personal data, processing) according to GDPR's requirements.
   - Simplify the process for giving and withdrawing consent, making it more straightforward and user-friendly."

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled? Users are presented with an opt-in option for non-essential cookies, but explicit consent is not clearly demonstrated due to the pre-ticked ""Accept All"" checkbox.
     - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can change their cookie preferences in the settings section at any time.
     - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, users can choose from different categories of cookies such as Technical, Audience measurement, Performance, Functional, and Marketing. However, technical cookies are pre-activated and cannot be deactivated individually.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? Yes, the policy mentions that some cookies may transfer data to third parties, including non-EU countries (including potentially the USA).
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? Yes, cross-border data transfers are mentioned but it is not clear if adequate safeguards have been implemented.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): [Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy does not provide a concise and precise definition of personal data as required by Article 4(11).
   - Article 7: [Partially Compliant + Reason] While users are given the option to withdraw their consent, explicit consent is not demonstrated due to the pre-ticked ""Accept All"" checkbox, which does not meet the GDPR's requirement for an active opt-in.

5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it outlines user options for cookie settings and mentions data transfers, but the active opt-in mechanism for non-essential cookies needs improvement to ensure explicit consent as required by the GDPR.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance:
     - Remove the pre-ticked ""Accept All"" checkbox and make sure users actively opt-in for non-essential cookies.
     - Clearly define personal data in accordance with Article 4(11) of the GDPR.
     - Address cross-border data transfers by implementing appropriate safeguards such as standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules or using Privacy Shield certified vendors."

Yes, the policy mentions the use of various third-party services such as Cloudflare, Google Tag Manager, Usercentrics Consent Management Platform, Adobe Target, ContentSquare, Google Ads Conversion Tracking, Google Analytics, Google Maps, LinkedIn Analytics, walls.io, YouTube Video, and ID to request consent data.
     - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? Yes, the policy mentions that data will be processed in countries outside the EU, including the USA and other third countries.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant + Reason: The policy does not provide clear definitions of terms such as ""personal data"", ""processing"", or ""controller"" in line with the requirements set out in Article 4(11).
     - Article 7: Compliant + Reason: The policy provides a means for users to give and withdraw consent, which aligns with the requirements set out in Article 7.
  5. Final Justification: Partially Compliant due to the lack of granularity in the consent mechanism and the absence of clear definitions of terms as required by GDPR Article 4(11).
  6. Improvement Suggestions:
     - To improve compliance, the policy could be updated to provide more granular options for users to accept or reject specific categories of cookies.
     - The policy should clearly define key terms such as ""personal data"", ""processing"", and ""controller"" in accordance with GDPR Article 4(11)."

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
      - Explicit consent is handled as users are asked for consent before cookies are set, and they can revoke it at any time. However, there isn't an easy way to withdraw specific types of consents.
      - Users can withdraw their consent easily by accessing the settings option and changing their preferences, but this doesn't allow them to withdraw specific types of consents.
      - Granular consent options are provided as users have the ability to accept or reject different categories of cookies (Technically required only, Analysis and statistics, Convenience, Services).
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
      - Third-party data sharing is outlined in the cookie policy as it mentions selected partners. However, specific details about each third party and the type of data shared aren't provided.
      - Cross-border data transfers are not addressed explicitly in the policy.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
      - Article 4(11): The policy explains what cookies are and their purpose, which falls under the definition of ""personal data"" as stated in Article 4(1). However, it doesn't specify whether cookies involve personal data or not, which is required for compliance with Article 4(11).
      - Article 7: The policy outlines that consent is obtained before cookies are set and provides an option to withdraw it at any time, which aligns with the general requirements of Article 7. However, it lacks specific information about how the consent was obtained (e.g., whether it was given in a clear and affirmative manner) and doesn't provide granular options for users to manage their consent preferences.

5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it provides options for users to manage their cookie preferences and obtain/withdraw consent, but it lacks clarity on third-party data sharing, cross-border data transfers, and granularity in consent management.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance include:
     1. Providing specific details about third-party data sharing partners, the type of data shared with them, and their purposes.
     2. Explicitly addressing cross-border data transfers in the policy.
     3. Enhancing the user interface to allow for granular management of cookie preferences (e.g., allowing users to withdraw specific types of consent).
     4. Clarifying that cookies involve personal data or not, as required by Article 4(11) of GDPR.
     5. Providing additional information about how consent was obtained and ensuring it meets the requirements of Article 7, including giving clear, affirmative, and granular options to users."

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled? Users are given clear options to accept all processing (Agree), allow only essential techniques (Decline), or customize their consent settings (Adjust). However, since the ""Agree"" option includes various purposes that require different types of consent under GDPR, it could be improved for more granularity.
     - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, they can adjust their consent settings at any time.
     - Are granular consent options provided? While there are some granular options available in the ""Adjust"" section, the combination of purposes under the ""Agree"" option could be improved for more GDPR-compliant granularity.
3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? Yes, third-party data sharing with advertising partners like The UK Trade Desk Ltd., Virtual Minds GmbH, and Trakken GmbH is clearly outlined.

     - Can users withdraw consent easily? The user can manage their cookie preferences at any time by clicking ""Manage Cookie Settings"" or visiting the Privacy Preference Center, making it relatively easy to withdraw consent.
     - Are granular consent options provided? While the user can select or deselect particular types of cookies (Technically Necessary Cookies, Functional Cookies and tools, Performance-related Cookies, tracking an analytics-tools, Social-Media and Marketing Cookies), they cannot provide individual consent for each specific cookie.
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The policy mentions that information collected about the user may be transferred outside the European Economic Area to the US, indicating some degree of third-party data sharing. However, it would be more transparent if specific third parties were named.
     - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? Yes, the policy acknowledges potential cross-border data transfers to the US.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): The policy does not explicitly define ""cookie"" as it should be defined under Article 4(11), which makes it non-compliant.
     - Article 7: The policy provides a clear and specific statement regarding the use of cookies, allowing users to actively provide their consent, making it compliant with Article 7.
  5. Final Justification: The main reason for classifying this Cookie Policy as Partially Compliant is due to the lack of explicit definition of ""cookie"" in accordance with GDPR Article 4(11).
  6. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance compliance, the policy should clearly define ""cookies"" according to Article 4(11), provide granular consent options for each individual cookie, and name specific third parties involved in data sharing when applicable."

   - The cookie policy provides information about the use of cookies, purpose of data collection, and the ability to withdraw consent. However, it lacks clarity regarding third-party data sharing and cross-border data transfers, which are essential for GDPR compliance.

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled? The policy mentions that users need to provide their consent to use cookies, but there is no clear indication of how this is obtained (e.g., active opt-in or pre-ticked boxes).
     - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, the policy states that users can revoke their consent with future effect. However, it would be more user-friendly if an easy method for revoking consent was clearly provided within the cookie banner.
     - Are granular consent options provided? The policy offers only two options: accepting all cookies or just necessary ones. A more granular approach to consent, allowing users to choose which types of cookies they agree to, would be compliant with GDPR requirements for transparency and user control.

  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? No, the policy does not provide sufficient information about any third-party data sharing that occurs as a result of cookie usage.
     - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? No, there is no mention of how cross-border data transfers are handled or if adequate safeguards are in place to comply with GDPR requirements.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant - The policy does not clearly define what constitutes a ""cookie"" and whether other tracking technologies (e.g., local storage) fall under this definition, as required by Article 4(11).
     - Article 7: Partially Compliant - While the policy mentions that users must provide consent to use cookies, there is insufficient clarity regarding the method of obtaining explicit and granular consent, which is essential for compliance with Article 7.

  5. Final Justification: The cookie policy is partially compliant because it provides some information about the use of cookies, data processing purposes, and the ability to withdraw consent. However, the lack of transparency regarding third-party data sharing, cross-border data transfers, and granular consent options prevents it from being fully compliant with GDPR requirements.

  6. Improvement Suggestions: To improve compliance, consider making the following changes to the cookie policy:
     - Clearly define what constitutes a ""cookie"" in accordance with Article 4(11).
     - Provide a more granular approach to obtaining consent, allowing users to choose which types of cookies they agree to.
     - Explain any third-party data sharing that occurs as a result of cookie usage and provide information about cross-border data transfers, including adequate safeguards in place for compliance with GDPR requirements.
     - Offer an easy method for revoking consent within the cookie banner itself."

   - The cookie policy provides information about the use of cookies, consent mechanisms, and data sharing with third parties, which are essential elements for GDPR compliance. However, it lacks clarity in addressing certain aspects such as the legal basis for processing personal data (Article 6) and providing users with the right to object (Article 21).

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
      - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides an option for users to accept all cookies, only essential cookies, or set preferences. However, it does not explicitly state that by using the website, users are accepting the use of cookies and the associated data processing activities. This should be made clearer.
      - Can users withdraw consent easily? Users can adjust their preferences at any time; thus, they can withdraw their consent for non-essential cookies.
      - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, users are given an option to select preferences or accept all cookies, indicating that granular consent is available.

  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
      - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? Yes, the policy mentions sharing data with third parties such as marketing partners and analytics providers like Facebook and Google.
      - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? Yes, it is mentioned that data may be processed in the USA and China, indicating potential cross-border data transfers. However, appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) should be specified to ensure GDPR compliance.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
      - Article 4(11): [Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy does not explicitly state the legal basis for processing personal data, which is a requirement under Article 4(11). This should be addressed to ensure compliance with GDPR.
      - Article 7: [Partially Compliant + Reason] Consent mechanisms are present in the cookie policy, but it lacks clarity regarding the legal basis and users' right to withdraw consent or object to processing. These aspects need to be improved to achieve full compliance with Article 7.

  5. Final Justification: The main reason for the partial classification is that while the policy provides information about cookies and consent mechanisms, it lacks clarity in addressing certain GDPR requirements such as the legal basis for data processing, users' right to withdraw or object to processing, and appropriate safeguards for cross-border data transfers.

  6. Improvement Suggestions:
      - Make it clear that by using the website, users are accepting the use of cookies and the associated data processing activities.
      - Specify the legal basis for data processing under Article 6.
      - Provide a clear and easy-to-understand explanation of users' rights to withdraw or object to processing under Articles 12, 15, and 20.

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
      - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides a granular approach for users to accept or decline different types of cookies based on their purposes and functions, which can be considered as handling explicit consent. However, the default option is set to ""Accept all processing,"" which could be seen as not obtaining truly informed and freely given consent.
      - Can users withdraw consent easily? Users are provided with an option to adjust their settings at any time; thus, they can withdraw or change their consent, making it easy for them to do so.
      - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, the policy provides a detailed list of different types of cookies and their purposes, allowing users to accept or decline them based on their preferences.
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
      - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The policy explains that partner data may be shared for advertising purposes and campaign success measurement. However, it does not specify which specific partners are involved in the data sharing process.
      - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? There is no explicit mention of cross-border data transfers in the provided cookie policy text.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
      - Article 4(11): The term ""controller"" is defined, but it is unclear if ""processors"" are explicitly mentioned. [Non-Compliant + Reason: While the concept of processors is implicitly mentioned through reference to partners (third-party controllers), there should be a clear mention of processors to ensure compliance with Article 4(11).]
      - Article 7: The policy provides users with choices regarding the processing of their personal data, and they are able to withdraw consent at any time. However, it does not offer clear and concise information about the purpose of the processing at the time of obtaining consent [Non-Compliant + Reason: To comply with Article 7, users must be provided with detailed and transparent information regarding the purpose of the processing at the time when they give their consent.]
  5. Final Justification: The classification is partially compliant due to unclear definitions of ""processors"" (Article 4(11)) and lack of transparency in providing clear and concise information about the purpose of data processing at the time of obtaining consent (Article 7).
  6. Improvement Suggestions:
      - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance:
        1. Clearly define ""processors"" to comply with Article 4(11) requirements.
        2. Provide a clear and concise explanation of the purpose of data processing at the time of obtaining consent to ensure compliance with Article 7.
        3. Clarify cross-border data transfer practices to ensure transparency and compliance with GDPR regulations."
advanced_explanation,partially-compliant,partially_compliant_40.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant
2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - Explicit consent is handled as users are required to actively grant permission through the cookie policy and privacy settings. Users can withdraw consent easily by adjusting their privacy settings or clicking on the Privacy Button. However, granular consent options are provided only at a purpose level (not for each vendor), which may not meet the expectations of GDPR for full transparency and control over data processing.
3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Third-party data sharing is outlined, but clarity could be improved as it's not explicitly stated that vendors who are not part of the IAB TCF (49) may also process personal data. Cross-border data transfers are not addressed in this policy.
4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): The definition and explanation of cookies and similar technologies can be considered compliant, as they provide sufficient information about the processing activities.
   - Article 7: Partially compliant, as users are informed about their rights to withdraw consent but granular consent is not provided at a vendor level, which could potentially limit transparency and control for users in line with GDPR expectations.
5. Final Justification: The policy provides some information regarding data processing activities and offers users the ability to exercise their rights, but additional clarifications on third-party data sharing and cross-border data transfers are necessary for full compliance with GDPR.
6. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance compliance, consider adding more specific details about third-party data sharing, particularly for vendors not part of the IAB TCF. Address cross-border data transfers in the policy, ensuring clarity and transparency regarding any potential risks or safeguards implemented. Additionally, offer granular consent options at a vendor level to provide users with greater control over their personal data processing."

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - Explicit consent is handled through the acceptance button for performance and marketing cookies, but the ""Accept All"" option does not allow for granular consent (only acceptance or rejection of all cookies). Users can withdraw consent by changing cookie settings, however this is not easily discoverable as it requires navigating to the settings.
     - Consent withdrawal is possible, but it's not straightforward and could potentially result in continued data processing before users change their settings.
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Third-party data sharing is outlined in the policy, but the level of detail could be improved. It would be beneficial to specify which third parties collect and process personal data, the purpose of the data processing, and the legal basis for transferring data to third countries outside the EU.
     - Cross-border data transfers are addressed, but users are informed that they grant consent for this action when clicking ""Accept All"". However, there is no mention of any measures taken to ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred outside the EU.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant (The cookie policy does not clearly identify the controller and the processor as separate entities).
     - Article 7: Partially Compliant (Explicit consent is obtained, but it's not granular or easily withdrawable).
  5. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements because it obtains explicit consent for cookies but lacks granularity in the consent mechanism and could improve transparency regarding third-party data sharing and cross-border data transfers.
  6. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Implement a granular consent mechanism that allows users to choose which categories of cookies they accept.
     - Provide more detailed information about third-party data processing, including specific parties involved, the purpose of the processing, and the legal basis for cross-border data transfers.
     - Clearly separate the roles of controller and processor in the policy as per Article 4(11).
     - Ensure that users can easily find and access cookie settings, and make it clear that they have the right to withdraw their consent at any time without continued processing of their data."

    The cookie policy provides some information on the types of cookies used and gives users the option to accept or reject all cookies. However, it lacks specificity in terms of explicit consent requirements (Article 7), data sharing transparency, and granular options for consent.

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled? (Non-Compliant)
       The policy does not clearly state how explicit consent from the user is obtained for each category of cookies. A clear and concise explanation should be provided for every type of cookie, and users should be given the option to accept or reject each category individually.
     - Can users withdraw consent easily? (Partially Compliant)
       The policy provides an option to manage consent preferences, but it does not specify how users can withdraw their consent completely after initially accepting cookies. A clear mechanism for withdrawal of consent should be available.
     - Are granular consent options provided? (Non-Compliant)
       The policy offers three broad categories (Allow All, Manage Consent Preferences, and Reject All), but it does not allow users to accept or reject specific types of cookies within those categories. A more granular approach is required for compliance with GDPR requirements.

  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? (Non-Compliant)
       The policy mentions that cookies may be used for marketing purposes but does not explicitly state whether this involves sharing data with third parties or service providers. A clear and concise explanation of any third-party data sharing should be provided in the cookie policy.
     - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? (Non-Compliant)
       The policy does not mention anything about cross-border data transfers, which may involve sharing personal data with entities located outside the EU/EEA. Any such transfers must comply with GDPR requirements for appropriate safeguards.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): [Non-Compliant + Reason]
       The policy does not define the terms ""controller"" or ""processor,"" which are essential for understanding who is responsible for compliance with GDPR in relation to the use of cookies.
     - Article 7: [Partially Compliant + Reason]
       While users are given the option to accept or reject cookies, the lack of granularity and explicit consent for each category of cookie means that Article 7 requirements may not be fully met.

  5. Final Justification:
     The cookie policy is partially compliant with GDPR due to its incomplete handling of explicit consent, granular options, data sharing transparency, and lack of definition for key terms such as ""controller"" or ""processor.""

     - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? The policy does not explicitly address cross-border data transfers.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): The policy explains that user consent is not required for strictly necessary cookies, which aligns with the definition of ""strictly necessary"" under Article 4(11). However, it does not provide a clear legal basis for processing personal data collected through performance and marketing cookies.
     - Article 7: While the policy offers a method for obtaining user consent, it does not explicitly state that the consent is specific, informed, and unambiguous, as required by Article 7(1). Additionally, the policy does not provide information about how long the consent will be stored or how it will be verified.

  5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR because it provides an option for users to give and withdraw their consent and offers granular consent options. However, it lacks specific details on data retention periods, legal bases for processing personal data, information about third-party data sharing, and clear explanations regarding cross-border data transfers.

  6. Improvement Suggestions: To improve compliance with GDPR, the following actions can be taken:
     - Provide more specific details on data retention periods, legal bases for processing personal data, and information about third-party data sharing.

   - Although there are granular options available within the ""Cookie Settings,"" these options could be presented more prominently and clearly to users before the cookies are set.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Third-party data sharing is outlined, but it could be made more clear that user data may be processed by Google in the USA, which has an insufficient level of data protection according to EU standards.
   - Cross-border data transfers are addressed, but users should be provided with a more detailed explanation and options to refuse these transfers if they wish.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): The policy does not explicitly define the terms ""controller"" or ""processor,"" although it indirectly refers to itself as a controller by stating that user data will be processed. (Non-Compliant)
   - Article 7: The policy provides an option for users to give and withdraw consent, which is a key requirement of this article. However, the information provided about the processing of personal data may not always be easily accessible or understandable, potentially failing to meet the requirements of transparency.

     - Article 7: [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] - The policy requests user consent for the use of cookies. However, it is not clear whether denying cookies equates to withdrawing consent, which may make it non-compliant with Article 7(4) unless a clear explanation is provided.
  5. Final Justification: The cookie policy is partially compliant due to unclear language regarding user consent withdrawal and the need for more detailed information on third-party data sharing and cross-border data transfers.
  6. Improvement Suggestions: To improve compliance, it is recommended that the policy clarify whether denying cookies equates to withdrawing consent, provide clearer information about third-party data sharing, and detail the measures taken to ensure cross-border data transfers comply with GDPR.

     - Can users withdraw consent easily? Users can modify the settings or withdraw consent through the ""Cookie settings"" link in the footer of the website, which is a positive point. However, the ease of withdrawal could be improved by providing clear and prominent options for users to withdraw their consent.
     - Are granular consent options provided? The policy provides different categories (Marketing & Analytics, Essential) but does not provide specific details about what each category entails, making it difficult for users to make informed decisions. A more granular approach is recommended.
3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The policy lists various third-party services (e.g., Google Ads, Facebook Custom Audiences) that are used for Marketing & Analytics purposes. However, the policy does not provide a clear and concise explanation of what data is shared with these third parties and for what purposes.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? The policy does not address this point explicitly. It is essential to mention any potential cross-border data transfers and ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, such as the EU's Standard Contractual Clauses or other appropriate safeguards.

   - Article 4(11): [Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy does not provide a clear definition of cookies and similar technologies, which is required under Article 4(11) of the GDPR. A clear explanation of these terms and their purposes is essential for informed consent.
   - Article 7: [Partially Compliant + Reason] While the policy provides an option to consent (albeit with generic terms), it does not meet all the requirements of Article 7, such as providing a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form to obtain user consent.
5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it offers users the option to consent or deny the use of cookies, but it lacks clarity in its explanation of what exactly the user is consenting to, and it does not provide a comprehensive definition of cookies as required by GDPR Article 4(11).
6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance include providing clear, concise explanations of what data is collected, why it's collected, and how it's used in the consent banner. This will help users make informed decisions about their privacy settings.
   - Offer granular consent options so that users can choose which specific categories of cookies they agree to have on their device.

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
   - How is explicit consent handled?
     - Consent is collected through a banner that appears at the bottom of the website, and users can choose between three options (Accept Only Essentials, Accept All, Save and Close). However, it's not entirely clear if the ""Save and Close"" option constitutes giving consent.
   - Can users withdraw consent easily?
     - Users can revoke their consent by deleting cookies from their browser or contacting the website owner directly, but there is no straightforward mechanism provided within the cookie policy itself.
   - Are granular consent options provided?
     - Yes, users are given the option to accept only essential cookies, or they can choose to accept all cookies (including analytics & performance and external content).

  3. Data Sharing Transparency:

   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed?
     - No, cross-border data transfers are not mentioned in the cookie policy.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): [Non-Compliant + Reason]
     - The definition of cookies does not seem to align with Article 4(11) as it only mentions ""essential"" and ""analytics & performance"" cookies, while not listing all the other types of cookies that may be covered under GDPR.
   - Article 7: [Partially Compliant + Reason]
     - While users are given the option to give consent, the process is not entirely transparent or user-friendly, and it's unclear if ""Save and Close"" constitutes giving consent.

  5. Final Justification:
   - The main reason for the classification is that while the cookie policy provides some details about cookies, it lacks specificity in defining cookies (Article 4(11)) and its consent mechanism is not fully transparent and user-friendly (Article 7).

  6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance include:
     - Clarifying the definition of cookies in the policy to align with Article 4(11) guidelines.

   - While the policy mentions that users must consent to cookie use, it lacks specificity regarding certain types of cookies and their purposes, which is a requirement under GDPR.

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled?
       - Users are asked for their consent upon visiting the website, but the options provided are not granular enough to meet GDPR requirements (e.g., it's not clear which specific cookies users are consenting to).
     - Can users withdraw consent easily?
       - The cookie settings can be adjusted at any time according to the user's wishes. This is a positive point, but more clarity and simplicity in the process could improve user experience.
     - Are granular consent options provided?
       - No, the current policy does not provide granular consent options for each type of cookie as required by GDPR.

  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined?
       - The policy mentions that third-parties may have access to the collected data but does not specify who these third-parties are or what their roles are in processing the data.
     - Are cross-border data transfers addressed?
       - There is no mention of cross-border data transfers, which is a crucial aspect for GDPR compliance.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:

       - While the policy requires user consent, it lacks clarity regarding specific types of cookies and their purposes, which is a requirement under Article 7.

  5. Final Justification:
     - The main reason for the classification is that the policy does not provide sufficient information about the types of cookies used, their purposes, third-party recipients, or cross-border data transfers, as required by GDPR.

  6. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance include:
       - Clarifying the types of cookies used, their purposes, and their impact on user experience.
       - Providing granular consent options that allow users to opt-in or out of specific categories of cookies.

  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled? The policy provides an option to accept all purposes, which implies explicit consent for those purposes. However, it does not require users to actively opt-in for each individual purpose.
     - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can revoke their consent via the Privacy Settings at the bottom of the website.
     - Are granular consent options provided? The policy allows users to choose between ""Allow all"", ""Only allow necessary"", and ""More options"". However, within ""More options"", it does not provide a way for users to give or withdraw consent for each individual purpose.

3. Data Sharing Transparency:
   - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? Yes, the policy lists 43 partners (IAB TCF Providers and Non-IAB TCF Providers) that process personal data. However, it does not specify whether these partners transfer data across borders.
   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? No, the policy does not explicitly address cross-border data transfers.

4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] - Compliant. The policy provides definitions of key terms such as ""personal data"", ""processing"", and ""controller"".
   - Article 7: [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] - Partially Compliant. While the policy allows users to give and withdraw consent, it does not provide a way for users to give or withdraw consent for each individual purpose in a granular manner as required by Article 7(4).

5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR because it provides some transparency about the use of cookies and allows users to give and withdraw their consent. However, it does not meet the requirement for giving granular consent for each individual purpose.

6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance could include:
     - Providing a way for users to give or withdraw consent for each individual purpose in a granular manner as required by Article 7(4).
     - Explicitly addressing cross-border data transfers and providing information about the safeguards used (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield) where relevant.

   - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? Yes, the policy acknowledges that data may be transferred to third countries and informs users of potential risks associated with such transfers.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
   - Article 4(11): [Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy does not provide a clear definition of personal data as required by this article.
   - Article 7: [Partially Compliant + Reason] While the cookie policy offers an opt-in mechanism for users to consent, it does not provide a ""clear and affirmative action"" (Article 4(11)) for each specific category of data processing. The granular options are only visible upon clicking ""Consent details,"" which may not be considered clear enough.

  5. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it offers an opt-in mechanism and provides some transparency about the use of cookies, data sharing, and cross-border data transfers. However, it fails to provide a clear definition of personal data as required by GDPR Article 4(11) and does not offer a clear and affirmative action for each specific category of data processing as mandated in Article 7.

  6. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance:
     - Revise the policy to provide a clear definition of personal data (GDPR Article 4(11)) and offer a separate opt-in option for each category of data processing (GDPR Article 7).
     - Improve the visibility of granular consent options and make them more accessible to users.

     - Can users withdraw consent easily? Yes, users can revoke their consent by changing their selection at any time under ""Cookie Settings"" at the bottom of the page.
     - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, users can choose to accept or decline different categories of cookies (Required, External Services and Functionalities, Statistics, Marketing).

  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? The policy outlines the use of third-party services like Google Maps, Adobe Analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc., but it could be more explicit about the purpose of data sharing and the specific third-party services involved.
     - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? Yes, the policy mentions that consent includes data transfers outside the EU/EEA with possible legal risks. However, it does not provide a link to the specific measures taken to ensure adequate protection for these transfers, as required under GDPR.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): [Compliant] - The policy provides clear and detailed information about cookies and similar technologies, making them ""similar"" processing operations as defined in Article 4(11).
     - Article 7: [Non-Compliant + Reason] - The policy does not clearly state that the user's continued browsing after the cookie banner appears constitutes implied consent for non-essential cookies, which is a requirement under GDPR.

  5. Final Justification: The classification as Partially Compliant is due to the lack of clarity regarding implied consent and the incomplete information about cross-border data transfers.

  6. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance:
        1. Clearly state that continued browsing after the cookie banner appears constitutes implied consent for non-essential cookies, as required under GDPR.
        2. Provide a link to the specific measures taken to ensure adequate protection for cross-border data transfers.

advanced_explanation,partially-compliant,partially_compliant_7.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - Explicit consent is handled through a clear notification and the requirement for users to actively accept cookies. However, granular options are not provided; users can only choose between accepting all or just necessary technologies. Withdrawal of consent is possible by adjusting privacy settings at any time, but there is no mechanism to reset the cookie policy after consent has been withdrawn, which could potentially persist user preferences.
     - Users cannot easily access and manage their consent preferences without navigating through multiple steps in the privacy settings. A more straightforward method of withdrawing consent or changing settings would enhance compliance.
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Third-party data sharing is outlined, but cross-border data transfers are only addressed in relation to processing personal data in the USA by Facebook and YouTube, which includes a warning about potential risks under European standards. However, details on other third parties are provided, such as AT Internet, Google Ads Conversion, Tag Commander, Form Protection (reCaptcha), Favorite Market Feature, Marketing & Advertising (Facebook Pixel and Pinterest Ads).
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): Non-Compliant as there is no description of the controller or the processor in the Cookie Policy. The entity responsible for processing personal data should be clearly identified according to the requirements of this article.
     - Article 7: Partially Compliant, since users are given a clear choice and informed about their consent options, but granular consent is not provided. The process for managing consent preferences could be improved by offering more control over individual cookies or data processing purposes.
  5. Final Justification: This cookie policy is partially compliant with GDPR due to the lack of granularity in consent mechanisms and non-compliance with Article 4(11) regarding identification of the controller or processor.
  6. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Include a more detailed description of the controller or processor in the Cookie Policy as required by Article 4(11).
     - Provide granular consent options to users, allowing them to manage their preferences more easily and precisely.
     - Offer a mechanism for resetting the cookie policy after consent has been withdrawn.

  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
       - The policy provides a definition of cookies, so it is in line with the GDPR definition (Article 4(11)).
     - Article 7: [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
       - The policy provides an active opt-in mechanism for the use of cookies, which complies with the requirement of explicit and informed consent under Article 7. However, it lacks information about the legal basis for processing cookie data and does not specify retention periods or provide clear information about users' rights regarding their personal data.

  5. Final Justification:
     - The policy is partially compliant with GDPR because it provides some information on the use of cookies, consent mechanisms, and third-party data sharing but lacks clarity in explaining the legal basis for processing cookies and does not provide detailed information about users' rights regarding their personal data.

  6. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance include:
       - Clearly stating the legal basis for processing cookie data (e.g., legitimate interests, contractual necessity).
       - Specifying retention periods for cookies and outlining users' rights regarding their personal data (access, rectification, erasure, portability).
       - Providing more detailed information about third-party data sharing, including the identities of the third parties involved and any cross-border transfers.
       - Incorporating a mechanism for easy revocation of consent within the cookie banner itself, rather than requiring users to send an email to the support team."
advanced_explanation,partially-compliant,partially_compliant_9.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Compliance Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Consent Mechanisms:
     - How is explicit consent handled? The policy allows users to explicitly grant their consent by clicking ""Allow all"" or adjusting their preferences in the ""More options"" section. However, necessary cookies are active regardless of user choice, which may not align with GDPR requirements for truly explicit consent.
     - Can users withdraw consent easily? Users can revoke consent at any time through the Privacy Settings at the bottom of the website.
     - Are granular consent options provided? Yes, users can select specific processing purposes and providers, although it is not explicitly stated whether this level of granularity aligns with GDPR requirements.
  3. Data Sharing Transparency:
     - Is third-party data sharing clearly outlined? Yes, the policy details third-party data processors and services used for necessary, statistics, and marketing cookies.
     - Are cross-border data transfers addressed? The policy does not explicitly mention cross-border data transfers; it would be recommended to provide more information about this aspect in line with GDPR requirements.
  4. GDPR Article Compliance:
     - Article 4(11): Compliant + Reason: The policy defines personal data and processing adequately.
     - Article 7: Partially Compliant + Reason: While the option to revoke consent is provided, necessary cookies are active regardless of user choice which may not align with GDPR requirements for explicit and informed consent.
  5. Final Justification: The policy only partially complies with GDPR because it requires users to grant consent for all purposes initially, but there is a lack of clarity regarding the impact of necessary cookies on users' rights to withdraw consent.
  6. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Actionable steps for enhancing compliance could include:
       - Clearly communicating that necessary cookies are always active and cannot be deactivated while still allowing users to adjust their preferences for other types of cookies.
       - Providing more information about cross-border data transfers, as well as ensuring the transparency of these transfers aligns with GDPR requirements.
     - It may also be beneficial to consult a legal expert specializing in GDPR compliance to review and ensure the policy meets all necessary requirements for full compliance."

- Withdrawal Option: Yes, users can withdraw their consent at any time by changing their settings. However, it's not immediately obvious how to do this upon first visit.
- Granular Consent: No, as the user is only given the option to accept all cookies or customize their choices without being able to selectively choose specific types of cookies for acceptance or rejection.
- Third-Party Data Transparency: Yes, the policy does provide information about the vendors used and a link to the privacy policy where more detailed information can be found.
- Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Non-Compliant with Article 4(11), as the user is not provided with clear and specific information about each type of cookie being used, nor are they able to give granular consent for each category. However, it complies with Article 7 by offering a means to withdraw consent at any time.
- Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR as it offers transparency regarding the use of cookies and the ability to withdraw consent. However, it does not meet the granular requirements for giving explicit consent for each type of cookie used, which is essential for full compliance with GDPR Article 4(11).
- Suggestions for Improvement: To improve compliance, consider offering a more granular option for users to accept or reject specific categories of cookies.

While the policy provides information about the use of cookies, it does not explicitly link the consent for data processing in the USA with Article 4(11)'s requirement for clear and specific information about the entities processing personal data.

   Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it offers granular control over non-essential cookies, provides a withdrawal option, and informs users about the use of cookies. However, it falls short in clearly specifying the third parties involved in data processing and explicitly linking consent for such processing to the requirements of Articles 4(11) & 7.

   Suggestions for Improvement: To fully comply with GDPR, the policy should explicitly state the identities of any third parties involved in data processing, clearly link the consent for data processing in the USA to Article 4(11)'s requirements, and ensure that users can easily understand and separate their consent for cookies from their consent for data processing.

- Granular Consent: Yes, the policy offers granular control over different types of cookies (functionality, analytics, marketing). However, the pre-ticked ""Accept All"" option could be a potential issue for granularity and unambiguous consent.

- Third-Party Data Transparency: Yes, the policy mentions that partners also use cookies and that user profiles may be created across websites and devices. It also notifies users that their data may be transferred outside the EU (Art. 49 (1) a GDPR). However, more specific information about these third parties would strengthen transparency.

- Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Partially Compliant. The policy provides information on the use of cookies and how to manage them, which aligns with Article 4(11). However, the pre-ticked ""Accept All"" option could potentially conflict with the requirement for explicit and unambiguous consent stated in Article 7.

Final Justification: The policy generally complies with GDPR requirements, but it should revise the pre-ticked ""Accept All"" option to ensure compliance with the principle of explicit and unambiguous consent as required by Article 7.

Suggestions for Improvement: To improve compliance, consider removing the pre-ticked ""Accept All"" option or clearly explaining that this option grants full access to all cookies and requires explicit user consent.

- Explicit Consent: Yes, users are presented with a clear choice to accept or decline cookies and have the option to modify their preferences later. However, it is not explicitly stated that the use of necessary cookies is based on the user's continued use of the site rather than explicit consent.

- Withdrawal Option: Yes, users can withdraw their cookie consent at any time by modifying their preferences in the cookie settings.

- Granular Consent: Partially Compliant. Users are given two options (accept all or necessary only) initially, but further granularity is provided within the cookie settings. It would be more GDPR compliant if all cookies were presented for user consent upon first visit, including those that have defaulted to 'off'.

- Third-Party Data Transparency: Yes, users are informed about the use of targeting cookies which track interests and browsing behavior for targeted advertising. However, it would be more transparent to list specific third parties involved in this process.

- Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Partially Compliant. While the policy provides users with choices, it does not sufficiently explain how consent will be stored and for how long, as required by Article 5(1)(a). Additionally, there is room for improvement in providing explicit consent for necessary cookies based on user interaction with the site (Article 4(11)).

Final Justification: The cookie policy provides users with choices and a withdrawal option, but it lacks transparency in data storage and explicit consent for necessary cookies. To ensure full GDPR compliance, these elements should be addressed by clearly stating how consent will be stored and obtaining explicit consent for all cookies based on user interaction.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Explicitly state that the use of necessary cookies is based on the user's continued use of the site, to ensure compliance with Article 4(11).
2. List specific third parties involved in data collection and tracking for targeted advertising.
3. Include information about how cookie consent will be stored and for how long in the privacy statement or cookie policy.
4. Provide an option to decline all cookies initially, rather than only 'necessary' or 'all'. This would offer a more granular approach to user consent, aligning more closely with GDPR requirements."

   - Final Justification: The policy provides users with choices regarding the use of cookies and informs them about their data protection rights.

It also explains how users can manage cookie settings in their browsers and what information is collected by cookies and where it's processed. However, it doesn't include an evaluation or recommendation, so I would suggest revising the text to make it clearer that it provides information rather than evaluating a specific topic.

Here are some suggestions for revisions:

1. Title: ""Understanding Cookies and Managing Consent on Websites""
2. Introduction: ""This article aims to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of cookies, their role in enhancing web experiences, and how you can manage your consent regarding cookie usage.""

However, it could improve its transparency regarding the specific processor where third-party data will be sent, as required by Article 4(11).
   - Suggestions for Improvement: Add more details in the policy about the specific processor where third-party data will be sent (as per Article 4(11)) to enhance transparency and ensure full GDPR compliance.

   - Third-Party Data Transparency: Yes, the policy informs users that third-party cookies may be set by social media services and advertising partners for targeted advertising purposes.
   - Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Partially Compliant, as while the policy provides information about cookies and their purposes, it does not explicitly state that cookie settings can be altered or blocked without unduly affecting the functioning of the site. This may potentially breach the user's right to withdraw consent under Article 4(11) and the principle of transparency in Article 7.
   - Final Justification: The Cookie Policy provides some transparency regarding the cookies used on the website and offers users an opportunity to manage their cookie preferences. However, it does not fully comply with GDPR because it does not explicitly allow for user consent to be withdrawn without affecting the site's functionality, which is essential for meeting the requirements of Articles 4(11) and 7.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To achieve full compliance with GDPR, the policy should make it clear that users can block or delete cookies without impacting the functioning of the site (although some functionalities may be limited). Users should also be provided with a genuine choice when it comes to individual cookie categories.

   - Final Justification: While the policy provides users with explicit consent to choose their cookie preferences, it falls short in certain areas of transparency. The retention periods and purposes for third-party cookies are not explicitly mentioned, which may violate GDPR requirements under Article 4(11) (clear and concise information about the identity of the data controller and the purposes of processing). Also, as per Article 7, individuals should be provided with a reasonable way to withdraw their consent easily and at any time. Improvements could include adding retention periods and purposes for all third-party cookies, making this information easily accessible, and simplifying the withdrawal process.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To fully comply with GDPR, consider providing more detailed information about each cookie (including their purpose, retention period, and data controller) in an easy-to-understand format. Simplify the withdrawal process by allowing users to revoke consent for specific cookies or all cookies with a single click, instead of requiring them to revisit the cookie policy page repeatedly.

      While the policy informs users about the use of cookies, it does not explicitly request or obtain affirmative and specific user consent for each category of cookies. Instead, it presents an option to ""Accept All"" without clear notice that this will lead to acceptance of all categories of cookies. This approach may not be GDPR-compliant as it requires users to actively opt-in rather than passively accepting the use of non-essential cookies.

   - Withdrawal Option: Yes (Compliant)
      The policy provides a ""Save & close selection"" option, which allows users to withdraw their consent by closing the cookie banner or changing their preferences at any time. This aligns with the GDPR requirement for providing a simple means to withdraw consent.

   - Granular Consent: No (Not fully compliant)
      The policy does not provide separate options for each category of cookies, making it difficult for users to give and withdraw granular consent for specific categories of cookies. This is an essential aspect of GDPR compliance as it allows users to control their data privacy preferences more effectively.

   - Third-Party Data Transparency: No (Not fully compliant)
      The policy does not provide adequate information about third-party cookies used, their purposes, or the third parties involved. This is a key requirement under GDPR, as it allows users to make informed decisions about whether they want to accept these cookies.

   - Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Non-compliant
      The policy does not comply with the GDPR's explicit consent requirements (Article 7) and its definition of consent under Article 4(11), as it does not provide clear, affirmative, specific, and informed opt-in consent for non-essential cookies. Furthermore, it does not adequately inform users about third-party data processing associated with non-essential cookies.

   - Final Justification:
      To ensure GDPR compliance, the website needs to provide clear, granular, and explicit consent options for each category of cookies, as well as detailed information on the use of third-party cookies, their purposes, and the third parties involved. This will allow users to make informed decisions about their data privacy preferences and give affirmative consent in line with GDPR requirements.

   - Suggestions for Improvement:
      - Provide separate options for each category of cookies (e.g., Essential, Statistics) to enable granular consent.
      - Explicitly ask users for consent to non-essential cookies through an affirmative action (e.g., a checkbox).
      - Clearly disclose the purpose and third parties involved with non-essential cookies.
      - Allow users to easily withdraw their consent at any time, either by updating preferences in the cookie banner or by contacting support.
      - Ensure that the policy is readily accessible and easy to understand for all users, particularly those who may not be familiar with the complexities of data privacy regulations."

   - Withdrawal Option: Yes (Users can manage their cookie preferences at any time)
   - Granular Consent: Yes, but only for functional, performance-related, tracking, analytics, social media, and marketing cookies. Technically necessary cookies are always active, which may not meet the granularity requirements under GDPR.
   - Third-Party Data Transparency: Yes (Users are informed that data collected by cookies may be transferred outside the EEA)
   - Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Partially Compliant (While explicit consent is obtained and a withdrawal option provided, the policy does not seem to comply fully with GDPR as technically necessary cookies are always active without offering users an option to reject them)
   - Final Justification: While the policy provides an option for users to manage their cookie preferences and informs users of data transfers outside the EEA, it does not offer the granularity required by GDPR regarding technically necessary cookies. This means that users do not have a choice over these cookies, which may lead to non-compliance with GDPR.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To achieve full compliance under GDPR, Symrise should provide an option for users to reject technically necessary cookies along with functional, performance-related, tracking, analytics, social media, and marketing cookies. This will ensure that the policy aligns fully with GDPR's requirements regarding explicit consent, granularity, and transparency."

   - Explicit Consent: Yes, users are explicitly asked to provide consent before non-essential cookies are set. However, the option ""Accept all"" may not be considered fully explicit as it gives no control over which specific types of cookies are accepted.
   - Withdrawal Option: Yes, users can revoke their consent at any time with effect for the future.
   - Granular Consent: No, users do not have granular control over different categories or specific types of cookies they accept.
   - Third-Party Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides information about third-party providers involved in cookie processing.
   - Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Partially compliant with Article 4(11), as users are not explicitly informed about the purpose of each type of cookie being set. However, it is compliant with Article 7 regarding consent and the right to withdraw it.
   - Final Justification: The policy provides transparency on the use of cookies and the option to revoke consent, which aligns with GDPR requirements for user consent and rights. However, it lacks granular control over different types of cookies and specific purposes, which could be improved to ensure full compliance.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To achieve full GDPR compliance, consider adding an option for users to selectively accept different categories or specific types of cookies (granular consent). Additionally, provide clearer information about the purpose of each type of cookie being set, as per Article 4(11) requirements."

   - Granular Consent: Yes, users are given the option to choose between essential cookies, personalised advertising, and detailed settings for tracking tags/trackers/analytic tools.
   - Third-Party Data Transparency: Yes, users are informed about the potential sharing of their data with third parties such as marketing partners, Facebook, and Google. However, more specific details about these third parties could be provided to enhance transparency.
   - Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Partially Compliant, while the policy explains the use of cookies and provides a method for users to give their consent, it could benefit from clearer language in line with Article 4(11)'s requirement for concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible information.
   - Final Justification: The cookie policy provides a reasonable level of transparency about the use of cookies and offers users control over their data, but could improve upon providing more specific details about third-party entities and using clearer language to comply fully with GDPR requirements.
   - Suggestions for Improvement:
    1. Provide more detailed information about third parties that may process user data, including their purpose and location (USA and China in this case).
    2. Review and revise the policy's language to ensure it is concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible, following Article 4(11) guidelines.
    3. Offer users more granular options for giving and withdrawing consent, such as separate opt-ins/opt-outs for each type of tracking or data sharing with third parties."

   - Explicit Consent: Yes, the policy informs users about the purposes for which their data will be processed and offers an option to consent or decline. The level of detail provided is sufficient to enable informed consent, but users may still need additional information on third-party partners (e.g., Utiq) to fully understand what they are consenting to.
   - Withdrawal Option: Yes, users can revoke their consent at any time, either via the Utiq data protection portal or within ""Customize"" → “Use of telecommunications-based Utiq technology for digital marketing.” Additionally, users can modify their preferences through the adjust option provided.
   - Granular Consent: Yes, the policy allows users to give their consent individually based on various purposes and functions, which aligns with granularity requirements under GDPR.
   - Third-Party Data Transparency: Partially Compliant, the policy provides information about partners involved (IAB TCF and Utiq), but it does not name all of them explicitly. It is essential to disclose all third-party processors to ensure full transparency.
   - Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Partially Compliant, the policy provides necessary information about processing activities and offers an option for users to give or withdraw their consent. However, it could be more explicit in outlining the legal basis for each type of processing.

   Final Justification: The cookie policy is mostly compliant with GDPR requirements, but it could benefit from providing a more detailed explanation of the legal basis for each type of data processing and disclosing all third-party partners involved to ensure full transparency.

   Suggestions for Improvement:
   - List all third-party processors explicitly in the policy.
   - Clearly state the legal basis for each type of data processing.
   - Offer a way for users to easily revoke consent and modify their preferences without navigating through multiple menus or settings.
   - Simplify language used in the policy to make it more accessible to all users."

   - Granular Consent: Yes, the policy allows users to adjust their privacy settings based on specific purposes and/or at a vendor level at any time.
   - Third-Party Data Transparency: Yes, the list of third-party vendors is provided, along with their respective purposes. However, it could be improved by providing more detailed information about each vendor and the type of data they process.
   - Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Partially Compliant, while the policy provides an option for users to give or withdraw consent, it does not meet all requirements set out in Article 4(11) regarding information that should be provided to data subjects. For example, there is no clear and comprehensive explanation of the legal basis for the processing of personal data.
   - Final Justification: The policy provides a mechanism for users to give or withdraw their consent for the processing of their personal data by third-party vendors. However, it falls short in meeting all requirements set out in Article 4(11) regarding the information that should be provided to data subjects, such as the purpose of the processing, the type of personal data being processed, the legal basis for the processing, and the retention period.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To achieve full GDPR compliance, the policy could be improved by providing more detailed information about each vendor, the type of data they process, the purpose of the processing, the legal basis for the processing, and the retention period. Additionally, a clear and comprehensive explanation of the legal basis for the processing of personal data should be provided to data subjects. The policy should also make it easy for users to understand their rights under GDPR, such as the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict, and object to the processing of their personal data. Furthermore, the policy could be made more user-friendly by simplifying language, using clear headings, and providing clear instructions on how users can exercise their rights."

- Withdrawal Option: Yes - Consent can be revoked at any time by changing the cookie settings.
- Granular Consent: No - Users are not provided with granular options to consent or refuse specific types of cookies, as they must accept all performance and marketing cookies together.
- Third-Party Data Transparency: Yes - The policy informs users that third parties may collect data through the use of cookies. However, it does not explicitly provide a list of each third-party vendor and their respective privacy policies, which could make it difficult for users to fully understand who has access to their data.
- Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Partially Compliant - The policy provides information about the use of cookies, the purposes of data processing, and identifies the data controller. However, the lack of granular consent options may not fully comply with GDPR requirements for obtaining explicit and informed consent.
- Final Justification: While the cookie policy provides some essential information required by GDPR, it falls short in ensuring users are provided with a clear, concise, and easily understandable explanation of their data processing rights, as well as the options to give or withdraw consent on a granular basis. The policy should be revised to ensure compliance with GDPR principles of transparency, fairness, and accountability.
- Suggestions for Improvement:
  1. Provide users with clear and concise explanations about each type of cookie and what data will be collected by each third-party vendor.
  2. Offer granular consent options, allowing users to accept or refuse specific types of cookies individually.
  3. Revise the policy language to ensure that it is easily understandable for all users, using clear and concise language without legal jargon.
  4. Ensure that users are informed about any changes to the cookie policy or data processing practices.

- Withdrawal Option: Yes - Users can change their cookie settings at any time by clicking on ""Cookie Settings"" at the bottom of the page and revoke consent with effect for the future.

- Granular Consent: Partially Compliant - While users can customize their preferences, the level of granularity could be improved as the policy does not provide a clear and easy way to distinguish between different types of cookies (e.g., functional, analytical, marketing) and the purposes they serve.

- Third-Party Data Transparency: Yes - The policy provides a list of data processing partners and services used by the website, including third-party service providers like Google Maps, Adobe Analytics, Facebook Pixel, and others. This information is presented in a transparent manner.

- Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Partially Compliant - Although users are informed about data transfers outside the EU/EEA and potential legal risks associated with it, the policy does not explicitly state that the legal basis for processing personal data is either consent or a legitimate interest, as required by Article 6 of the GDPR.

Final Justification: The cookie policy presents users with clear choices regarding cookies and offers an option to customize their preferences. However, it could be improved in terms of providing explicit information about the types of cookies being used and ensuring granularity in obtaining consent. Additionally, clarifying the legal basis for processing personal data would help ensure compliance with GDPR requirements.

Suggestions for Improvement:
- Clearly list the different types of cookies (e.g., functional, analytical, marketing) and their purposes to provide a higher level of granularity when obtaining consent.
- Explicitly state the legal basis for processing personal data (either consent or legitimate interest). If consent is the legal basis, ensure that the wording used reflects this.
- Provide more detailed information about each third-party service provider, such as their location and any relevant certifications they may hold, to further demonstrate transparency and build trust with users.
- Consider offering users a way to easily access and manage their cookie settings from within the website or app, rather than relying solely on the initial popup. This would improve usability and ensure that users can easily revoke or modify their consent choices at any time."

Additionally, the combined consent for data processing in the USA by Facebook and YouTube may not fully comply with the specific requirements of Article 4(11).

- Final Justification: The policy offers a choice for cookie usage and provides information on third-party data processors, but it could be improved to meet the strict requirements of GDPR, particularly regarding explicitness, granularity, and legal compliance. Specifically, separate consent should be obtained for data processing in the USA by Facebook and YouTube, users should be given a more detailed explanation of their rights to object or withdraw consent, and options should be provided for a more granular level of preference management.

- Suggestions for Improvement:
    - Offer separate consent for data processing in the USA by Facebook and YouTube, clearly outlining the associated risks and benefits.
    - Provide a more detailed explanation of users' rights to object or withdraw their consent at any time.
    - Allow users to adjust their preferences with greater granularity, including opt-in/opt-out options for each third-party data processor.
    - Consider consulting with a legal expert to ensure compliance with GDPR requirements regarding explicitness and transparency in the cookie policy."

   - Third-Party Data Transparency: Yes, users are informed that some cookies may be placed by third parties appearing on the pages. However, more detailed information about specific third-party providers and purposes could be added for greater transparency.
   - Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Compliant, the policy provides clear information about the use of cookies, explains how cookies enhance user experience, and offers an option to refuse non-essential cookies. However, it could be more explicit in stating that cookies are used only when consent is given.
   - Final Justification: The cookie policy is generally GDPR compliant, as it informs users about the use of cookies, provides granular control over consent, and offers a withdrawal option. However, for greater transparency, specific information about third-party providers could be added to meet Article 4(11)'s requirement for explicit information.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To fully comply with GDPR, the cookie policy could provide more detailed information about third-party cookies, including their purposes and the specific providers involved.

- Explicit Consent: Yes, users are informed about the purposes of data processing and given options to allow or deny specific types of cookies. However, the ""Allow all"" option may cause confusion as it combines both necessary and optional cookies under one agreement.

- Withdrawal Option: Yes, users can revoke consent at any time by accessing the Privacy Settings at the bottom of the website.

- Granular Consent: Partially, granularity is provided for different categories of cookies (necessary, statistics, marketing), but there seems to be a lack of clarity in the ""Allow all"" option which groups them together, potentially not fully meeting the GDPR requirement for explicit consent.

- Third-Party Data Transparency: Yes, users are informed about the specific data processing providers and services used.

- Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Non-Compliant, while there is transparency regarding the purposes of data processing, the ""Allow all"" option may not meet the GDPR requirement for explicit and informed consent since it bundles necessary and optional cookies under one agreement.

- Final Justification: The cookie policy provides a good starting point in terms of informing users about the use of cookies and offering them the choice to opt out or customize their preferences. However, the lack of clarity in the ""Allow all"" option may put it at odds with GDPR requirements for explicit and informed consent.

- Suggestions for Improvement: To achieve full compliance with GDPR, consider separating necessary cookies from optional ones when offering consent. Offer clear and separate options for each category, allowing users to make informed choices about the data they are willing to share. Additionally, clarify the ""Allow all"" option to ensure that it is not interpreted as a bundled agreement for both necessary and optional cookies."

   - Granular Consent: No, users are not given the option to accept or reject specific types of cookies.
   - Third-Party Data Transparency: Partially Compliant, some information about vendors is provided, but details about third-party data processing and transfers outside the EEA are vague.
   - Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Non-compliant, as the policy does not provide sufficient information to allow users to freely give and withdraw their consent in a clear and informed manner.

It fails to clearly explain what data will be collected, for which purposes, and by whom it will be shared or transferred. Additionally, users are not given the option to accept or reject specific types of cookies.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Provide a clear and concise explanation of the different types of cookies used, their purposes, and the parties involved in processing the data.

   - Third-Party Data Transparency: Yes (The policy mentions the use of third-party cookies and provides descriptions for each category)
   - Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Non-Compliant (The policy does not meet the requirements for explicit and informed consent, nor is it as easy for users to manage their preferences as GDPR demands)

Final Justification: The policy fails to meet GDPR compliance standards because it does not offer users a transparent, easily accessible method for providing and managing cookie consent. Additionally, it does not provide granular control over the types of cookies that can be stored or accessed on user devices.

Suggestions for Improvement: To become fully compliant with GDPR, the policy should be revised to provide an explicit, easily accessible opt-in mechanism for users to consent to the use of cookies. The consent process should offer granular control over the types of cookies that can be stored or accessed on user devices.

   Withdrawal Option: Yes - Users can manage their preferences at any time by clicking on ""Cookie Settings,"" allowing them to withdraw or modify their consent.

   Granular Consent: Partially Compliant - The policy offers granular control over third-party data processing, but it could be improved by providing more information about each category and service, making the process of giving consent more transparent and user-friendly.

   Third-Party Data Transparency: Yes - The Cookie Settings provide a list of the data processing providers and services used on the website, helping users understand how their data will be processed.

   Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Compliant - The policy clearly informs users about the use of cookies, and provides options to give or withhold consent for different categories of cookies. This aligns with Articles 4(11) (defining personal data as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person) and 7 (right to withdraw consent).

   Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements by offering users the option to give or withhold consent for cookies. However, it could be improved by providing more detailed information about each category of cookie and ensuring that essential cookies are included in the initial consent request. This would help users make informed decisions and ensure they are fully aware of how their data will be used.

   Suggestions for Improvement: To fully comply with GDPR, consider revising the policy to provide more detailed information about each category of cookie, ensuring that essential cookies are included in the initial consent request, and making the process of giving consent more transparent and user-friendly.

   Final Justification: The cookie policy partially complies with GDPR as it provides options for consent, withdrawal, and some transparency about third-party data processing. However, it lacks granularity in consent options and specific information about the categories of personal data being processed, which are essential requirements under GDPR.

   Suggestions for Improvement: To fully comply with GDPR, the policy should provide an option to actively choose each type of cookie a user consents to (granular consent).

     Article 4(11) requires that consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her. Article 7 requires that whenever the processing is based on the data subject’s consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data. In this case, the policy does not provide sufficient information about the specific purposes for which each category of cookie is used and the third parties with whom data will be shared, which could make it difficult for users to provide truly informed consent.
   - Final Justification: The Cookie Policy provides an initial level of GDPR compliance by asking for explicit consent from users and offering a withdrawal option.

   - Withdrawal Option: Yes, the user has the option to withdraw their consent at any time by changing their cookie settings.
   - Granular Consent: Partially, the policy provides options to accept or reject necessary and statistical cookies, but it does not offer a granular level of control over each individual cookie used.
   - Third-Party Data Transparency: Yes, the policy clearly states the providers (e.g., 2B-Advice, etracker.com, Cloudflare) for most cookies, though some third-party cookies do not provide information about their retention period.
   - Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Partially Compliant, the policy informs users about the use of cookies and provides an option to give or withdraw consent, but it may not always meet the requirement for specificity as per GDPR.
   - Final Justification: The cookie policy provides a basic level of compliance with GDPR by offering options for explicit consent, withdrawal, and transparency regarding third-party data. However, it does not offer a granular level of control over individual cookies, and the information provided about each cookie's purpose may be insufficient to meet the requirement for informed consent under GDPR.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To fully comply with GDPR, the policy should provide more detailed information about the purpose of each cookie and offer a granular level of control over individual cookies used on the website. This will ensure that users have a clear understanding of how their data is being used and can make informed decisions accordingly.

     The cookie policy provides an option to consent to the storage of cookies, which is a requirement under GDPR. However, it does not explicitly state that users have the right to withdraw their consent at any time or offer granular control over the types of cookies they accept.

   - Explicit Consent: Yes, but with limitations
     The user is required to actively click on ""Accept all"" in order to give consent for cookie storage. However, it does not explicitly state that users have the option to withdraw their consent at any time.

   - Withdrawal Option: No, with limitations
     There is no explicit statement or option given to the user to withdraw their consent after it has been initially given.

   - Granular Consent: No, with limitations
     The user is not offered granular control over the types of cookies they accept. While the user can choose between ""Reject all"" and ""Accept all"", there is no option to selectively accept or reject specific categories of cookies.

   - Third-Party Data Transparency: Yes, with limitations
     The policy mentions that third-party cookies (marketing cookies) may be set by advertising partners via the website and can be used to create a profile of user interests for targeted advertising. However, it does not provide comprehensive information about these third parties, such as their identities or purposes beyond 'targeted advertising'.

   - Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Partially Compliant
     The policy complies with Article 4(11) in that it provides information on the use of cookies and the ability to give or withdraw consent. However, it does not fully comply with Article 7 as it does not offer granular control over the types of cookies and does not explicitly state that users have the right to withdraw their consent at any time.

   - Final Justification:
     The cookie policy provides a basic level of compliance with GDPR regulations regarding cookie usage, but it could be improved by offering more transparency about third parties, providing granular control over cookie acceptance, and explicitly stating that users have the right to withdraw their consent at any time.

   - Suggestions for Improvement:
     To bring the policy into full compliance with GDPR regulations, consider adding the following features:

     1. Offer granular control over different categories of cookies (necessary, performance, marketing).
     2. Explicitly state that users have the right to withdraw their consent at any time and provide a straightforward method for doing so.
     3. Provide comprehensive information about third parties who set cookies on the website, including their identities and purposes beyond 'targeted advertising'.

However, it fails to meet the spirit of the GDPR in providing clear and concise information about the types of cookies used, the purposes they serve, and who they are shared with.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To fully comply with GDPR, the policy should be revised to provide more detailed information about each category of cookie, including the specific purposes they serve and any third parties involved in their use.

   - Withdrawal Option: Yes, users can withdraw their consent at any time by changing their settings in the ""Customize"" option or by accessing the Privacy Policy and exercising their rights.
   - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, as while users are given the option to customize their consent settings, pre-ticked options may not meet the GDPR standard for granularity due to the potential for bundling multiple purposes into one consent request (Article 7(4)).
   - Third-Party Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides information about third-party advertising partners and data processing activities related to their services. However, more detailed information about the specific purposes of each partner's data processing could be beneficial for transparency.
   - Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Partially Compliant, as while the policy provides information about cookie processing and the option to give or withdraw consent, it may not meet all the requirements of Articles 4(11) and 7 regarding explicit and granular consent due to pre-ticked options.
   - Final Justification: The cookie policy is partially GDPR compliant, as it informs users about the purposes of data processing related to cookies and provides options to accept or decline them. However, pre-ticking certain consent options may not meet the GDPR standard for explicit and granular consent. It is important for Kaufland Marketplace GmbH to review their cookie policy and ensure that all options are actively opted-in by users to fully comply with GDPR requirements.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To improve compliance, consider the following suggestions:
    1. Remove pre-ticked consent options and require active user opt-in for any processing beyond technically necessary cookies.
    2. Provide more detailed information about each third-party advertising partner's data processing activities to enhance transparency.
    3. Offer granular control over the purposes for which users' personal data will be processed, ensuring that each purpose has an independent consent option.

- Granular Consent: Yes, users are given the opportunity to individually determine their consent based on various purposes and functions of cookies. This level of granularity allows users to make informed decisions about their personal data usage.

- Third-Party Data Transparency: Partially Compliant, as the policy mentions partners involved in the IAB TCF but does not name each partner. While it provides links to learn more about data storage duration and consent revocation options, this lack of transparency may still raise concerns under GDPR Article 4(11).

However, it could be improved by making initial consent more explicit, granular, and informed, as well as providing a clearer and more concise explanation for users about potential risks related to transferring data to third countries outside the EU.

   - Suggestions for Improvement:
     To fully comply with GDPR, consider revising the policy to provide an option for explicit consent before allowing cookies to be set. This could include displaying a clear and concise notice about each type of cookie and its purpose before prompting users to accept or reject it individually. Additionally, offer more information and clarity about potential risks associated with transferring data to third countries outside the EU, and provide easy-to-understand language throughout the policy."

   - Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Partially Compliant (The policy provides information but could benefit from more clarity and simplicity in language, especially for non-English users)

Final Justification: While the policy provides an option to consent and withdraw that consent, it does not offer a clear and easily understandable explanation of the types of cookies and data processing being carried out, which may be a concern under GDPR's requirement for transparency. The use of auto-translated non-English versions of service descriptions also raises questions about the level of accuracy and clarity provided.

Suggestions for Improvement: To ensure full compliance with GDPR, it is recommended to:
1. Simplify the language used in the cookie policy, ensuring it is easily understood by all users regardless of their native language.
2. Provide clear and concise explanations of each category and service listed, using plain language that is easy for all users to understand.
3. Implement a system that automatically translates these explanations accurately into different languages.
4. Offer an option for users to save their preferences, making it easier for them to manage their consent over time.

   Final Justification: While the provided cookie policy offers some GDPR-compliant elements such as explicit consent, withdrawal options, and granular control over cookies, it lacks clarity regarding third-party data transparency and fails to provide a complete description of the processing activities, their legal basis, and retention periods.

   Suggestions for Improvement: To ensure full GDPR compliance, consider adding specific details about each third party's purpose for processing data, how they will process user personal data, and establish clear descriptions of the legal basis for each processing activity along with associated retention periods.

Final Justification: The policy partially meets GDPR requirements by offering users a choice about cookie usage and providing an option to change their preferences at any time. However, it falls short in terms of transparency by not disclosing the specific details of third-party vendors and the purposes of each type of cookie. This could be misleading for users, potentially violating the spirit of informed consent required under GDPR.

Suggestions for Improvement: To comply fully with GDPR, the policy should explicitly state that continued use of the site implies consent to non-essential cookies, and provide detailed information about each third-party vendor, their purposes, and their data processing practices.

   - Withdrawal Option: Yes, users can change their selection at any time via the cookie button at the bottom of the website.
   - Granular Consent: Partially, as users are given the option to accept or reject all cookies, but a more granular approach would allow for individual acceptance or rejection of each category or service.
   - Third-Party Data Transparency: Yes, users are informed that their data may be processed by third parties such as Google and YouTube, Inc., and are provided with links to further information about Google's data processing.
   - Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Partially compliant, as the policy provides some information regarding the use of cookies and the processing of personal data, but it could be improved by providing a clearer explanation of each category of cookie and its purpose to meet the requirements for explicit and informed consent.
   - Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it provides users with the option to accept or reject all cookies and informs them about the processing of their data, but it could be improved by providing a clearer explanation of each category of cookie and its purpose to meet the requirements for explicit and informed consent.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To fully comply with GDPR, the policy should provide a more granular approach to consent, allowing users to accept or reject each category or service individually. It should also provide a clearer explanation of each category of cookie and its purpose to ensure that users are fully informed about what they are consenting to.

   - Granular Consent: Partially (The policy provides granularity in terms of cookie categories but does not explicitly state how users can choose which specific cookies they accept or reject.)
   - Third-Party Data Transparency: Yes (The policy mentions that data might be transferred to countries outside the EEA and mentions potential impact on user's rights.)
   - Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Non-Compliant
   - Final Justification: The policy does provide an option for users to consent or reject cookies, but it lacks specificity in allowing users to choose which individual cookies they accept or reject. This is crucial for compliance with GDPR as per Article 7(4), which states that when processing is based on consent, the data subject should have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The policy does not fully comply with Article 4(11) as it does not clearly and distinctly inform users about the identity of the data controller.
   - Suggestions for Improvement:
     1. Provide a more detailed and granular consent mechanism, allowing users to choose which specific cookies they accept or reject.
     2. Clearly identify the data controller in the cookie policy to comply with Article 4(11) of GDPR.
     3. Consider providing additional information about the purpose of each type of cookie (necessary, functional, and targeting), as well as any third-party involved in the processing of cookies.

   - Final Justification: The policy provides an initial level of compliance by offering users the ability to control their cookie settings. However, it falls short of full compliance by not providing a clear and concise explanation of the purpose of each type of cookie as required under GDPR Article 4(11). This lack of clarity may make it difficult for users to make informed decisions about which cookies they wish to allow.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To bring the policy into full compliance with GDPR, the bank should provide a clear and concise explanation of the purpose of each type of cookie in an easily accessible manner.

   - Third-Party Data Transparency: Partially Yes
     The policy does list the third-party vendors used on the website, but it does not provide sufficient information about the specific purposes for which each vendor processes data.

   - Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Non-Compliant
     The policy does not meet the requirements of Article 4(11), as it does not specify the legal basis for processing necessary data (e.g., legitimate interests, contractual necessity). Additionally, it fails to comply with Article 7 by not providing clear and concise information about each data processing activity and its purpose in an easily accessible manner.

   - Final Justification:
     While the policy offers users the opportunity to give or withdraw their consent for data processing activities, it falls short in terms of transparency, granularity, and compliance with GDPR articles 4(11) and 7. To achieve full compliance, the policy should provide more detailed information about each vendor's purpose, allow users to give/withdraw consent on a more granular level, and specify the legal basis for processing necessary data.

   - Suggestions for Improvement: To bring the cookie policy into full compliance with GDPR, it would be beneficial to explicitly list the specific cookies within each category (analytics & performance and external content) and provide additional information about the third parties involved in processing those cookies. This would help users understand exactly what data is being collected, how it will be used, and who will have access to it. Additionally, using more explicit language when explaining the purposes of each cookie category could further enhance transparency and consent."

   - Explicit Consent: Yes, users are explicitly asked to give consent for the use of cookies. However, there is no requirement for the user to actively opt-in, only to deselect ""Accept all cookies"" if they wish to deny consent. This could be improved to meet the GDPR standard of requiring active opt-in.
   - Withdrawal Option: Yes, users can manage their cookie preferences at any time. This is in compliance with GDPR requirements as it allows users to easily withdraw their consent.
   - Granular Consent: Yes, users are given the option to selectively accept or deny different categories of cookies. This level of granularity meets the GDPR requirement for explicit and informed consent.
   - Third-Party Data Transparency: Yes, there is a clear statement about third-party recipients in the cookie policy text. Users are directed to detailed information about cookies, their purposes, third-party recipients, lifespan, etc., which meets GDPR requirements for transparency.
   - Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Partially Compliant. While there is a clear statement asking for consent and providing information about cookies, the requirement for active opt-in for all non-essential cookies under GDPR has not been fully met.
   - Final Justification: The policy provides a clear explanation of the use of cookies and offers users the ability to manage their preferences. However, it falls short in terms of explicitly requiring active opt-in for non-essential cookies, which is a key requirement under GDPR.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To fully comply with GDPR, the policy should require active opt-in for all non-essential cookies, ensuring that users have given clear and explicit consent before any non-essential cookies are set on their device. Additionally, consider providing a link to the Privacy Policy within the cookie banner itself, making it more easily accessible to users."

   - Third-Party Data Transparency: Yes (The policy provides a list of third-party data processing providers)
   - Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Partially Compliant
   - Final Justification: The policy meets the requirements for explicit consent, withdrawal option, and granular consent as stated in GDPR. However, it is not fully compliant due to a lack of transparency regarding the purpose of each specific cookie and its legal basis. Article 4(11) states that consent should be ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous."" While users are given the option to customize their preferences, they may not fully understand the implications of each choice due to insufficient information about the purpose of each cookie. Article 7 requires that there should be ""easy access to information, in particular the identity of the data controller and the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended."" The policy provides this information but it could be made clearer and more accessible.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To improve compliance with GDPR, the cookie policy should provide a clear and concise explanation of the purpose of each specific cookie and its legal basis. This can be achieved by adding brief descriptions next to each processing purpose in the ""More Options"" section or creating an easily accessible FAQ page that addresses common questions about cookies.

   - Final Justification: The cookie policy provides an option for users to give their explicit consent and offers a withdrawal option. However, it could be more explicit about the types of data being collected, the purposes of the processing, and the third-party services involved.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: 1) Provide clear, concise information about the types of cookies used and their purposes. 2) Offer granular consent options instead of a binary ""Accept all"" or ""Decline all"". 3) Enhance transparency by explicitly stating the third-party services involved in data processing. 4) Clearly explain the purpose of the processing as required under Article 13(1)(c)."

This would help users make informed decisions about their consent and better understand their rights under GDPR.
   - Suggestions for Improvement:

   - Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Partially Compliant, while the policy provides a method for obtaining consent, it does not clearly specify how long the cookie retention period will be, which is required under Article 5(e) GDPR. Also, the policy lacks transparency regarding the specific data processing activities carried out by third parties, which may raise concerns about the provision of clear and concise information as required under Article 12 GDPR.
   - Final Justification: The Cookie Policy satisfies some essential requirements for GDPR compliance, such as providing users with a choice in accepting or refusing cookies and offering an option to withdraw consent at any time. However, it fails to provide sufficient detail about third-party data processing activities and the retention period of cookies, which are crucial aspects under GDPR regulations.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To achieve full GDPR compliance, the following suggestions can be implemented:
    1. Specify the retention period of each cookie category in the policy.
    2. Provide more detailed information on third-party data processing activities, such as links to their individual privacy policies or comprehensive explanations of their data processing practices.
    3. Consider offering users a way to delete their stored data in accordance with Article 17 GDPR, in addition to the option to withdraw consent.

   - Third-Party Data Transparency: Yes, users are informed that some cookies may be placed by third parties appearing on our pages. However, more detailed information about these third parties could be provided for better transparency.
   - Legal Compliance (Articles 4(11) & 7): Partially Compliant. Although the policy complies with providing explicit consent and a withdrawal option, it does not strictly follow Article 4(11)'s definition of essential cookies (i.e., only strictly necessary cookies should be active before user consent is obtained). The marketing cookies might be considered non-essential under this interpretation, and users could have already received personalized advertising without their explicit consent.
   - Final Justification: The policy provides users with the option to give explicit consent for cookie usage and offers a withdrawal option. However, it should review and potentially limit the use of marketing cookies before user consent is obtained to ensure compliance with Article 4(11).
   - Suggestions for Improvement:
    1. Review the classification of marketing cookies as essential or necessary under GDPR requirements. If marketing cookies are non-essential, consider delaying their activation until explicit user consent is given.

The website uses both first-party and third-party cookies for various purposes such as personalizing content, improving the user experience, and collecting usage statistics. The text explains that most websites use cookies, which are small text files stored by your internet browser during your visit to a site.

   The website provides options for users to manage their cookie preferences. Users can accept or reject all cookies or make selections based on specific categories (e.g., analytics and marketing). If users choose to reject cookies that require consent, the website will stop placing these types of cookies during their next visit to a new page. However, revoking consent for cookies may limit some features and content availability on the site.

   The text also mentions that in some cases, cookie information may be processed outside the extended European Union (EU) in countries with data protection laws that might not meet EU standards. To ensure appropriate protection of the collected information, additional security measures like contracts based on EU standard contractual clauses and technical measures have been implemented. If users give consent to the ""Analytics and Marketing Cookies"" category, they also agree to the transfer and further processing of cookie information in countries outside the extended EU.

   Users are encouraged to learn more about managing cookies via their browser settings (enable, disable, or delete) to adjust their preferences accordingly. Changes in cookie settings may impact some features on the website, as explained earlier in the text."

However, the policy could benefit from more specific explanations about what each category of cookie does and how user data will be used.

- Withdrawal Option: Yes, users can revoke their consent at any time in the Cookie Manager within the privacy policy.

- Granular Consent: Partially compliant. While users can choose to accept all cookies or only technically necessary ones, a more granular approach would be preferable, allowing users to accept or reject specific categories of cookies.

- Data Transparency: Yes, users are provided with information about the categories of cookies used and their purposes. However, more detailed information about data collection, processing, and sharing could enhance transparency.

- Final Justification: The policy meets some GDPR requirements but lacks clarity in certain areas, particularly when it comes to explaining how user data will be used. A more explicit explanation would help users make informed decisions and ensure they fully understand the implications of their choices.

- Improvement Suggestions:
  1. Provide clear and concise explanations for each category of cookie, including examples of what type of data will be collected and how it will be used.

Key Points:
- Explicit Consent: Yes, users are presented with the option to accept or deny cookies and can also customize their preferences. However, the granularity of the consent is not clear as it does not specify which specific cookies are associated with each category (Necessary, Performance, Marketing).
- Withdrawal Option: Yes, users can change or revoke their consent at any time through the Privacy Preference Center.
- Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, as while users can customize their preferences, the lack of clarity regarding specific cookies makes it difficult for users to make informed decisions.
- Data Transparency: Yes, some information about the cookies used is provided, but more detail about the data collected and how it is used would be beneficial.

Final Justification: The policy provides a means for users to consent or withdraw their consent to the use of cookies. However, the lack of clarity in the granularity of consent could potentially lead to confusion among users.

Improvement Suggestions:
1. Clearly label each category (Necessary, Performance, Marketing) with specific cookies associated with them for greater transparency and granularity of consent.
2. Provide more detailed information about the data collected, how it is used, and any potential data transfers to countries outside the EU.

- Withdrawal Option: Yes, users can change their cookie preferences at any time.
- Granular Consent: Partially compliant, as while users can choose different categories of cookies (essential, analytics & performance, and external content), specific third-party cookies are not listed separately for user consent.
- Data Transparency: Partially compliant, as the policy does provide some information about the types of cookies used and their purposes but lacks transparency on the exact third parties that set the cookies.

Final Justification: The policy provides a means to obtain and manage cookie consent, yet it is not fully transparent and granular as required by GDPR, particularly in terms of third-party cookies.

Improvement Suggestions:
1. Clearly list specific third parties that may set cookies on the website.

- Withdrawal Option: Yes, users can change their selection at any time under ""Cookie Settings"" at the bottom of the page and revoke consent with effect for the future.
- Granular Consent: Partially compliant. While users can customize preferences, the ""Accept Everything"" option does not meet granularity requirements as it does not explicitly mention each type of cookie and its purpose.
- Data Transparency: Yes, detailed information about cookies is provided under ""More Information."" However, it would be more user-friendly to include this information in the initial consent screen or make it easily accessible without requiring the user to click away from the main page.

Final Justification: The policy provides an option for users to give and withdraw their consent, but the ""Accept Everything"" option does not meet granularity requirements as it does not explicitly mention each type of cookie and its purpose. Additionally, while detailed information about cookies is provided, it is not easily accessible from the initial consent screen.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Clearly label the ""Accept Everything"" option to indicate that it accepts all types of cookies, not just essential ones.
- Improve the visibility and accessibility of cookie information on the initial consent screen or provide a summary of each type of cookie and its purpose within the consent screen itself.

- Withdrawal Option: Yes - Users can revoke their consent at any time by accessing the Privacy Settings on the bottom of the website.
- Granular Consent: Partially Compliant - While users can choose between different categories of cookies, they do not have the option to select individual cookies within each category.
- Data Transparency: Yes - The policy clearly lists the types of personal data processed and the providers used for this purpose. However, more transparency could be provided about the specific cookies used by each provider.
- Final Justification: Although the policy presents users with options to choose different categories of cookies, it does not fully comply with GDPR guidelines as it lacks granularity in the consent process and defaults to ""necessary"" cookies without offering an option to individually decline them.
- Improvement Suggestions:
  - Offer the option for users to choose individual cookies within each category (e.g., specific marketing cookies) to ensure granular consent is provided.
  - Clearly label which cookies are necessary and explain why they cannot be deactivated, while still providing an option to decline them if desired.

- Withdrawal Option: Yes, users can withdraw their consent at any time by clicking on ""Cookie Settings"" in the website footer.
- Granular Consent: Partially compliant, as the option to choose specific categories of cookies is provided but it's not clear what each category entails (e.g., 'Marketing' includes a long list of individual services).
- Data Transparency: Yes, some information about the purpose and use of cookies is provided, but it could be more detailed and easier to understand for the average user.

Final Justification: The policy provides an option for users to give and withdraw consent, and some transparency regarding the use of cookies.

      - Data Transparency: Yes, the service providers and categories of cookies are listed, but detailed information about the specific data processed by these providers is not provided.

   - Final Justification: The policy provides a clear choice for users to accept or deny cookies and offers an option to manage preferences. However, the lack of granularity in consent options may pose issues under GDPR, which requires that users are able to freely give and withdraw their consent.

   - Improvement Suggestions:
     1. Offer more granular control over third-party services within each category (e.g., allow users to select specific functional cookies instead of just enabling or disabling the entire category).

- Explicit Consent: Yes, users are clearly informed about the use of cookies and require explicit consent for analytics, personalization, and marketing purposes.
- Withdrawal Option: Yes, users can revoke their consent at any time in the Cookie Manager.
- Granular Consent: Partially, while users can choose specific categories (analytics, personalization, marketing), there is no option to accept only technically necessary cookies.
- Data Transparency: Yes, users are informed about the purpose of each category of cookie and the data collected.

Final Justification: While this policy provides information about the use of cookies, it falls short in offering a granular choice for users as they cannot accept or reject individual categories of cookies other than the technically necessary ones. This may not fully comply with GDPR's requirement for granular consent.

      - Withdrawal Option: Yes, users can modify their settings or withdraw consent through the ""Cookie settings"" link in the footer of the website. However, it is not clear how this affects data already collected before the withdrawal.

      - Granular Consent: No, there is no option to provide granular consent for specific categories of cookies or third-party providers. Users can only agree or deny all cookies.

      - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides some information about the types of cookies used (marketing, analytics, essential), but it lacks detailed explanations of each category and the specific purposes of data processing.

- Final Justification: While the policy allows users to agree or deny cookie usage, it does not provide sufficient detail about the data processing activities, making it difficult for users to make informed decisions. This could potentially lead to a lack of genuine consent, which is not compliant with GDPR requirements.

- Improvement Suggestions:
  1. Provide specific details about each category of cookies (marketing, analytics, essential) and the third-party providers involved.
  2. Offer granular consent options for users to choose which categories or specific cookies they agree to.
  3. Clarify how data is used, purpose of processing, and any potential retention periods.
  4. Explain how users can exercise their data subject rights, such as access, correction, erasure, and data portability.
  5. Make sure that the withdrawal of consent also includes the deletion or anonymization of previously collected data."

      - Withdrawal Option: Yes, users can change their cookie preferences at any time by visiting the cookie settings.
      - Granular Consent: No, users are not able to accept or reject each category individually.
      - Data Transparency: Yes, a brief description is provided for each category of cookies and what they do (essential, analytics & performance, external content).

- Final Justification: The policy provides clear information about the use of cookies and an option to manage preferences; however, it does not meet the GDPR requirement of granular consent.

- Improvement Suggestions:
  1. Provide users with the ability to accept or reject each category individually (granular consent).
  2. Consider adding a clear and concise explanation for the use of third-party cookies, as well as any potential sharing of data with these parties.
  3. Consider providing more detailed information about data retention periods for cookies and how long they are stored on users' devices.

     - Withdrawal Option: Yes, users can adjust their cookie settings at any time.
     - Granular Consent: Partially Yes, while users can adjust their cookie preferences, the categories are quite broad (necessary, performance, functional, marketing) and may not provide enough granularity to meet GDPR requirements for specific types of cookies.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, detailed information about cookies, their purposes, third-party recipients, etc., is provided in the Cookie Policy and within the cookie settings page.
   - Final Justification: The policy provides a clear consent banner and withdrawal option, but it could benefit from more specificity in explaining the data collection and usage to users, as well as offering more granular control over the types of cookies that are set.
   - Improvement Suggestions:
    1. Provide a clearer explanation of the purposes and specific types of cookies being used.
    2. Offer more granular options for cookie consent, allowing users to accept or reject individual categories of cookies instead of just broad categories.

Key Points:
- Explicit Consent: Yes, users must explicitly consent before cookies are set. However, the default option is not ""strictly necessary"" cookies only, which is required under GDPR for explicit and informed consent.
- Withdrawal Option: Yes, users can revoke their consent at any time via the Privacy Settings at the bottom of the website.
- Granular Consent: Partially compliant. While users have some control over the types of cookies they accept, the default option is not granular enough to meet GDPR requirements for a clear distinction between necessary and non-necessary cookies.
- Data Transparency: Yes, users are informed about the purposes for which their data will be used and the list of providers involved in processing that data.

Final Justification: The policy provides some level of transparency and offers an option to withdraw consent. However, it falls short of meeting GDPR requirements by not providing a granular default option for users to explicitly consent to non-necessary cookies.

Improvement Suggestions:
1. Revise the default option to provide a more explicit consent for necessary cookies only.
2. Offer a granular option that allows users to accept or reject different types of cookies, including non-necessary ones.
3. Clearly separate and highlight the purpose and function of each type of cookie in an easily understandable manner.

Key Points:
- Explicit Consent: Yes, the user is asked for explicit consent by clicking ""Accept all"" or ""Decline all"". However, it could be argued that the request for consent is not easily distinguishable as it is grouped with other options.
- Withdrawal Option: Yes, the user can revoke their consent at any time which has no influence on the lawfulness of previous processing.
- Granular Consent: No, the user is only presented with two options: ""Accept all"" or ""Decline all"". There is no option to selectively accept or decline specific types of cookies.
- Data Transparency: Yes, some information about the purpose and transfer of data is provided. However, more detailed information about the specific cookies used, their providers, and retention periods would be beneficial for transparency.

Final Justification: While the policy provides a consent mechanism, it falls short in providing granular control to users over the types of cookies they accept. Additionally, more detailed information about the data processing could improve transparency.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Provide clear and separate buttons for each type of cookie (Analytics, Marketing, etc.) so users can give informed consent for specific categories.
- Offer more detailed information about the cookies used, their providers, and retention periods in the consent details section.
- Consider using more easily distinguishable language when asking for consent to make it clear that the user is providing consent."

- Explicit Consent: Yes, the user is given three options to accept, decline or customize preferences. However, the granularity could be improved.
- Withdrawal Option: Yes, users can change their selection at any time and revoke consent for future processing.
- Granular Consent: Partially compliant. The user can choose between essential cookies, external services, statistics, and marketing cookies. However, it lacks the ability to provide granular consent for specific third-party services within these categories.
- Data Transparency: Yes, detailed information about the types of cookies used, their purpose, and the data processing partners is provided. However, the level of transparency could be improved by providing more specific details about data transfer locations and potential legal risks.

Final Justification: The policy provides users with options to accept or decline cookies and offers a withdrawal option. While it lacks some granularity in consent management and could benefit from improving the level of transparency regarding data transfer locations, it is partially compliant with GDPR requirements.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Improve granularity by allowing users to select specific third-party services within each cookie category (required, essential, statistics, marketing).
- Provide more detailed information about data transfer locations and potential legal risks associated with data transfers outside the EU/EEA.

- Withdrawal Option: Yes, users can adjust their cookie settings at any time.
- Granular Consent: Partially, while users can select specific cookies to accept or reject, the granularity is not exhaustive (e.g., no separate consent for Google Ads Conversion, Pinterest Ads, etc.).
- Data Transparency: Yes, some details on how cookies are used and options for managing them are provided, but further clarification could be beneficial regarding data sharing with third parties like Facebook and YouTube.

Final Justification: The policy provides users with the option to adjust their cookie settings and offers a withdrawal option. However, it lacks granularity in consent management and requires more explicit language for processing data in the USA by third-party providers.

Improvement Suggestions:
1. Provide more detailed information on data sharing with third parties like Facebook and YouTube, including the risks associated with such data transfer.
2. Offer a more granular consent management system, allowing users to accept or reject specific cookies (e.g., Google Ads Conversion, Pinterest Ads).

- Withdrawal Option: Yes, users can change or revoke their consent at any time in the Privacy Information section.
- Granular Consent: Yes, users are provided with options to accept or reject specific types of cookies (Necessary, Preference, Statistics, Marketing). However, there seems to be no option for Unclassified Cookies.
- Data Transparency: Yes, users are informed about the purpose and categories of cookies used on the site, and their data processing activities are disclosed in the Privacy Policy.

Final Justification:
The policy meets some GDPR requirements such as providing explicit consent, a withdrawal option, and transparency regarding cookie purposes. However, it lacks granularity for unclassified cookies, which should be addressed to ensure full compliance.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Classify Unclassified Cookies to provide users with the option to accept or reject them, ensuring granular consent is provided.
- Clearly state whether third parties have access to necessary cookies or not, as GDPR requires a clear explanation of who has access to personal data.
- Provide a more user-friendly interface for managing cookie preferences, such as allowing users to adjust their settings on the cookie banner instead of redirecting them to another page."

- Withdrawal Option: Yes, the user can revoke consent at any time by accessing the Privacy Settings.
- Granular Consent: Partially compliant, while users have some level of control over data processing purposes and providers, not all options are clear or easily understandable (e.g., 39 subservices under Adform).
- Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides information about the types of personal data processed and the data processing providers/services used.

Final Justification: The policy includes an explicit consent mechanism, a withdrawal option, and data transparency. However, the granularity of consent could be improved to ensure users fully understand and can control the use of their data more easily.

Improvement Suggestions:
- Simplify the list of marketing providers (e.g., Adform with 39 subservices) by breaking it down into clear, manageable categories.
- Offer a granular consent option that allows users to select specific processing purposes and providers they agree to, rather than just three broad options (Allow All, Only Necessary Allow, More Options).

   - Main Compliance Analysis:
      - The policy explains the use of cookies and provides a method for users to withdraw consent, which meets some GDPR requirements. However, it does not clearly obtain explicit consent prior to the placement of cookies, which is required by the GDPR.
      - The ability to customize consent choices is present, but the technical cookies are activated without the user's consent, which may not align with the GDPR's principles of transparency and user control.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
      - If explicit consent was not obtained, it would result in non-compliance with the GDPR, as users would not have given their clear and informed agreement to the use of cookies on the website.
      - If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, it could lead to complaints or potential legal action due to a lack of user control over their data.
      - Mandatory granular consent would require users to explicitly agree to each type of cookie category, which may improve transparency but could also negatively impact the user experience if too many prompts are presented.
      - If data sharing with third parties is not transparent and clearly explained, it could result in non-compliance with GDPR requirements for data protection, particularly as data may be transferred to third countries outside the EEA without adequate safeguards.
      - Data transfer to non-EU countries without safeguards would likely lead to non-compliance with the GDPR, as it is essential to ensure an adequate level of protection for users' personal data when transferring it to third countries.
   - Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements by providing a method for users to withdraw their consent and disclosing the use of cookies for various purposes. However, it does not clearly obtain explicit consent prior to the placement of cookies, which is required under the GDPR.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To achieve full compliance, the policy should explicitly obtain explicit user consent prior to the placement of cookies, and technical cookies should be deactivated by default until users provide their consent. Additionally, more transparency should be provided regarding data sharing with third parties, and appropriate safeguards must be in place for any data transfer to non-EU countries."
counterfactual_scenario,compliant,compliant-1.docx,mistral:latest," Classification: Partially Compliant

Main Compliance Analysis: The policy provides notice about the use of cookies, explains their purpose (essential, marketing, and statistical), and offers users the ability to adjust their consent settings. However, it does not clearly explain what constitutes ""personalized"" advertising and lacks transparency regarding data sharing with third parties. Additionally, the use of non-EU services without mentioning safeguards is concerning.

Counterfactual Impact:
1. Non-obtaining of explicit consent: The institution would be non-compliant with GDPR as obtaining user consent is a key requirement for lawful cookie processing. This could result in enforcement action and potential fines.
2. Difficulty in withdrawing consent: While the policy allows users to adjust their settings at any time, it does not explicitly state this information clearly or make it easy to access. This would negatively impact GDPR compliance as users should be able to easily revoke their consent.
3. Mandatory granular consent: If granular consent was required, the current policy would not meet this standard due to the lack of specific information regarding each cookie category and the purpose they serve. This would necessitate updating the policy to provide more detailed information about the cookies being used.
4. Opaque data sharing with third parties: The absence of transparency regarding data sharing with third parties puts the institution at risk of non-compliance with GDPR, as it does not allow users to make informed decisions about their data privacy.
5. Transferring data to non-EU countries without safeguards: If data is being transferred to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the EU-US Privacy Shield, then the institution would be non-compliant with GDPR, potentially leading to enforcement action.

Final Justification: The policy provides some necessary elements for compliance but lacks transparency and clarity in key areas, putting the institution at risk of non-compliance with GDPR. Improvements are needed to ensure that users can make informed decisions about their data privacy and to comply with GDPR requirements.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Clearly explain what constitutes ""personalized"" advertising in the cookie policy.
2. Provide transparent information regarding data sharing with third parties, including specific details of the data being shared and the purpose of the data sharing.
3. Update the policy to ensure granular consent is provided for each category of cookies used on the institution's websites.
4. Include appropriate safeguards when transferring data to non-EU countries, ensuring compliance with GDPR requirements.
5. Regularly review and update the cookie policy to ensure ongoing GDPR compliance."
counterfactual_scenario,compliant,compliant-10.docx,mistral:latest," Classification: Partially Compliant

Main Compliance Analysis: The policy provides users with the option to manage their cookie preferences, which is a key requirement under GDPR. However, explicit consent for non-essential cookies is not obtained upon the user's first visit to the website as per GDPR guidelines (Article 6(1)(a)). Furthermore, the policy lacks transparency in data transfer to third parties and does not specify whether adequate safeguards are in place for international data transfers.

Counterfactual Impact:
1. If explicit consent was not obtained, it would lead to non-compliance as user's preferences and choices would not be documented, making it difficult to prove legitimate interest or compliance with the GDPR's consent requirements.
2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, this would negatively impact compliance as the ability to withdraw consent is a fundamental right of data subjects under GDPR (Article 7(3)).
3. Mandatory granular consent would increase transparency and control for users but may present challenges in implementation due to the complexity of managing multiple categories of cookies. This could potentially lead to an overwhelming user experience, making it difficult for users to understand and make informed choices.
4. Lack of transparency in data sharing with third parties can lead to non-compliance as users are not properly informed about who has access to their data and how it will be used.
5. Data transfer to non-EU countries without safeguards would be a breach of GDPR, specifically Article 46 and 47, which require appropriate safeguards for personal data transfers outside the EU.

Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR by providing users with the ability to manage their cookie preferences but falls short in obtaining explicit consent for non-essential cookies upon a user's first visit and lacking clarity regarding third-party data sharing and international data transfers.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Obtain explicit consent for non-essential cookies upon the user's first visit to the website, ensuring that the user understands the purpose of each category of cookie.
2. Provide clear information about third-party data sharing, including the specific purposes and recipients of the data being shared.
3. Ensure that adequate safeguards are in place for any international data transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or binding corporate rules (BCRs).
4. Consider simplifying the cookie settings to make it easier for users to understand and manage their preferences without being overwhelmed by too many options.
5. Regularly review and update the cookie policy to ensure compliance with any changes in GDPR guidelines or user expectations."

   - Main Compliance Analysis: The cookie policy provides users with the option to accept or reject cookies, as well as manage their preferences. However, it does not clearly state that consent is a legal requirement and fails to provide an easy method for users to withdraw their consent. Additionally, the data transfer to the USA is only declined if non-essential cookies are rejected, but this information should be presented more prominently.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. If explicit consent was not obtained, it would make the policy non-compliant as per Article 6 of GDPR which emphasizes the need for a clear and affirmative action to confirm consent.
     2. If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, this would negatively impact compliance as it does not adhere to the user's rights under GDPR.
     3. If granular consent was mandatory, compliance could improve as long as the method for granting and withdrawing consent is simple and transparent. However, since the current policy only offers a basic level of granularity, additional improvements would still be necessary.
     4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, this would make the policy non-compliant as per Article 13 which requires information about data transfers to be provided.
     5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards, this would lead to non-compliance since such transfers must comply with GDPR requirements for international data transfers (e.g., using Standard Contractual Clauses or binding corporate rules).
   - Final Justification: The cookie policy partially complies with GDPR by providing options to manage cookies but falls short in obtaining explicit consent, making it easy to withdraw consent, and ensuring transparent communication about data transfer to the USA.

   - The policy also allows users to withdraw their consent by managing settings, which is compliant with the GDPR's emphasis on providing easy access to withdrawal options.
   - However, the policy does not clearly communicate whether third-party cookies are used or if personal data is shared with these parties, which could potentially violate GDPR's transparency requirement.
   - The policy also lacks explicit consent for advertising cookies and doesn't specify whether granular consent is mandatory, which is a grey area under GDPR.

   Counterfactual Impact:
   1. If explicit consent was not obtained, it would render the cookie policy non-compliant as obtaining explicit user consent is a key requirement under GDPR.
   2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, it could lead to violations of GDPR's user control rights and may result in fines or legal action.
   3. If granular consent was mandatory, the current policy would need to be updated to provide separate options for each category of cookie (e.g., essential, functional, advertising) as per GDPR requirements.

   - Main Compliance Analysis: The policy provides users with choices regarding cookie acceptance, informs them about data transfer outside the EU, and includes links to privacy policy and partner list. However, it does not explicitly state that consent for analytics and marketing cookies is obtained only if a user actively selects ""Accept All"" or changes settings from ""Only Required"". Additionally, there's no clear indication of how users can easily withdraw their consent once given.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
    1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the policy would be non-compliant as it does not provide a mechanism to obtain active user consent for analytics and marketing cookies.
    2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, the policy would be in violation of GDPR's requirement for providing clear mechanisms for users to manage their data consent preferences.
    3. Making granular consent mandatory would require additional effort to ensure that each category of cookie is clearly described, and users have explicit control over their acceptance or rejection. This would bring the policy into full compliance with GDPR.
    4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, the policy would be non-compliant as it does not explicitly mention who these partners are and what type of data they may collect.

Main Compliance Analysis:
- The cookie policy provides users with the ability to accept or reject cookies, which meets the transparency requirement of GDPR.
- However, users are not explicitly asked for consent at the start of their browsing session (passive or active scanning), which is a strict requirement under GDPR.
- Additionally, necessary cookies are always active, which might raise questions about their necessity and whether they could be made deactivatable.
- The policy provides links to privacy notice, cookie settings, and site notice, but it's unclear if the information provided meets all GDPR requirements.
- The data sharing with third parties is transparent, as users are informed about it.
- It is not explicitly mentioned whether appropriate safeguards are in place for data transfer to non-EU countries.

Counterfactual Impact:
1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the policy would be non-compliant with GDPR, potentially leading to fines and user trust issues.
2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, this would also violate GDPR, causing potential legal repercussions and damaging user trust.
3. Mandatory granular consent would require users to actively select which types of cookies they allow or reject. This could improve transparency and control but may impact website usability if too many options are presented.

     1. The policy explicitly informs users about the use of cookies, provides options to accept or reject them, and allows for management of preferences. However, there is no evidence of explicit consent being obtained upon the first visit (GDPR requires affirmative action such as clicking an ""Accept"" button). This needs improvement.
     2. Users are able to withdraw consent via Cookie Settings, but the ease of this process could be improved. The policy should provide clear instructions and make it simple for users to withdraw consent at any time.
     3. Granular consent is not mandatory, but the policy does allow users to manage their preferences. If granular consent were required, adjustments would need to be made to ensure each category of cookie (Strictly Necessary, Performance, Functional, Targeting) has its own consent checkbox.
     4. Data sharing with third parties is not explicitly disclosed within the Cookie Policy text. In order to be compliant, any data sharing with third-party cookies should be transparent and clearly communicated to users.
     5. There is no mention of data transfer to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards in the provided text, which raises concerns about compliance if such transfers occur. Data protection regulations such as GDPR require adequate safeguards when transferring personal data outside the EU.

   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. Not obtaining explicit consent upon first visit would result in non-compliance with GDPR, potentially leading to fines and loss of trust from users.
     2. If users cannot easily withdraw consent, they may feel a lack of control over their data, impacting user experience negatively and possibly leading to legal action or further regulatory scrutiny.
     3. Mandatory granular consent would provide more transparency and control to users, enhancing trust and ensuring compliance with GDPR. However, it might increase the complexity of the Cookie Policy and implementation.
     4. Failing to disclose data sharing with third parties could result in breaches of privacy rights and non-compliance with GDPR regulations.

Also, there is no clear information about data transfer to non-EU countries and the safeguards implemented in such cases.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. If explicit consent was not obtained, it would render the policy non-compliant as GDPR requires explicit and informed consent for all forms of cookie usage.
     2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, it would impact compliance as users may feel coerced into accepting cookies due to the inconvenience of revoking their consent.

     - Data sharing with third parties was not transparent: If data sharing with third parties is not transparent, this would be non-compliant under GDPR, which requires clear and concise information about data processing activities.
     - Data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards: This would be non-compliant as transfers of personal data to countries outside the EU must comply with GDPR's data protection rules, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the Privacy Shield Framework.
   - Final Justification: The cookie policy partially complies with GDPR as it offers users options to accept cookies and requires consent for functional and targeting cookies.

   Main Compliance Analysis:
   - The policy provides clear information about the use of cookies, their purpose, and user choices. It also offers options to customize preferences which aligns with GDPR's principles of transparency and choice. However, it falls short in some areas:
     - Explicit consent is not directly obtained upon loading the site (only implied with continued navigation). This may not meet the strict requirements of explicit consent under GDPR.
     - There is no mention or provision for users to easily withdraw their consent. This could lead to non-compliance if users wish to revoke their consent at a later time.
     - The policy does not seem to require granular consent, but it does offer options to customize preferences which could be seen as a form of granularity.
     - Data sharing with third parties is mentioned, but there is no clear specification about the purpose and legal basis for such data processing, which should be provided under GDPR.
     - There is no mention of appropriate safeguards for transferring data to non-EU countries, although it can be inferred that 'Google' may involve such transfers.

   Counterfactual Impact:
   - If explicit consent was not obtained (implied consent only), it could potentially lead to non-compliance with GDPR as explicit consent is required for most cookies under the regulation. This would put the organization at risk of fines and reputational damage.
   - If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, they may feel a lack of control over their data which could result in dissatisfaction, loss of trust, and potential legal action.
   - If granular consent was mandatory, it would require users to explicitly opt-in for each category of cookies, increasing the complexity of the process but potentially improving user transparency and control.
   - If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, it could lead to non-compliance as GDPR requires clear communication about such activities. This could also negatively impact users' trust in the organization.
   - If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without appropriate safeguards, it would violate GDPR and potentially expose the organization to fines and legal action.

   Final Justification: The current policy partially complies with GDPR due to its transparency and user control options but falls short in obtaining explicit consent, providing easy withdrawal of consent, clarifying data sharing purposes, and ensuring appropriate safeguards for international data transfers.

   Suggestions for Improvement:
   - Obtain explicit consent from users upon loading the site.
   - Implement a mechanism that allows users to easily withdraw their consent at any time.
   - Clearly specify the purpose and legal basis for data sharing with third parties.
   - Ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for international data transfers, such as standard contractual clauses or Privacy Shield certifications."

   Main Compliance Analysis:
   - The policy provides options for users to manage their cookie preferences, which aligns with GDPR requirements.
   - The policy also explains the purpose of different types of cookies, allowing users to make informed decisions.
   - However, the policy does not explicitly state that data processing is based on consent, and there's no record of when and how consent was obtained.
   - The policy also lacks transparency regarding third-party data sharing for marketing purposes.

   Counterfactual Impact:
   1. Non-Compliance Scenario: If explicit consent was not obtained, it would be non-compliant with GDPR as it would be processing personal data without a valid legal basis. This could lead to fines and reputational damage.
   2. Impact of users unable to withdraw consent easily: This would contravene the user's right to withdraw consent at any time, which is a requirement under GDPR. It may lead to potential complaints or lawsuits.
   3. Mandatory granular consent: If granular consent was mandatory and the current policy does not support it, there would be non-compliance with GDPR, as users should have the ability to accept or reject specific types of cookies.
   4. Opaque data sharing with third parties: Lack of transparency regarding data sharing with third parties would mean that users are not adequately informed about how their data is being used, which goes against GDPR principles.
   5. Data transfer to non-EU countries without safeguards: Without proper safeguards in place for international data transfers (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield), the organization would be non-compliant with GDPR.

   Final Justification: The cookie policy, while providing some level of transparency and control to users, lacks essential elements required by GDPR, such as explicit consent records and transparency regarding third-party data sharing.

   Suggestions for Improvement:
   1. Implement a mechanism for recording when and how users provide their consent.
   2. Clearly state that data processing is based on user's consent in the cookie policy.
   3. Provide more detailed information about third-party data sharing practices, including specific partners involved.
   4. If necessary, consider implementing granular consent for cookies.
   5. Ensure proper safeguards are in place for international data transfers if they occur."

   Main Compliance Analysis:
   - The cookie policy informs users about the use of cookies, their purpose, and the option to accept or reject them. This aligns with GDPR's transparency requirements.
   - Users are provided an option to adjust their settings, but there is no explicit statement that they can withdraw consent easily, which might be problematic under GDPR.
   - The policy mentions granular consent for advertising cookies, which could be considered as a step towards compliance with GDPR's requirement for explicit and informed consent.
   - Data sharing with third parties is transparently disclosed, but the level of detail provided about these parties might not meet the GDPR standard of ""clear and concise.""
   - No information is provided about data transfer to non-EU countries without safeguards, which is a direct violation of GDPR.

   Counterfactual Impact:
   1. If explicit consent was not obtained, it would render the policy non-compliant with GDPR as user's choice wouldn't be informed and explicit.
   2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, it would violate the principle of giving users control over their personal data, which is a core requirement under GDPR.
   3. Making granular consent mandatory could improve transparency and give users more control over their data, potentially strengthening compliance with GDPR.
   4. Lack of transparency in data sharing with third parties could lead to user distrust and potential legal consequences due to non-compliance with GDPR.
   5. Transferring data to non-EU countries without safeguards would definitely result in non-compliance with GDPR, as it breaches the principle of ensuring protection for personal data when transferred outside the EU.

   Final Justification: While the policy provides some information and options to users, it falls short on multiple requirements set by GDPR, particularly around the ease of withdrawing consent and transparency in data sharing with third parties and data transfer to non-EU countries.

   Suggestions for Improvement:
   - Clearly state that users can easily withdraw their consent at any time.
   - Provide a more detailed list of the third parties involved, including links to their respective privacy policies.
   - Include information about data transfer mechanisms used when moving data outside the EU (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses or Binding Corporate Rules)."

Main Compliance Analysis: The policy provides a clear explanation of the types of cookies used, offers multiple consent options, and allows users to change or withdraw consent at any time. However, it lacks transparency in data sharing with third parties as only the names of the services are listed without further detail about their specific purposes or how personal data will be processed.

Counterfactual Impact:
1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the policy would be Non-Compliant because GDPR mandates that users must give clear and explicit consent for data processing.
2. If users cannot easily withdraw consent, this could potentially lead to a Complaint as users might feel their rights are being violated, even though the option to change settings is available.
3. If granular consent was mandatory, the policy would need to provide more detailed options regarding individual preferences for each type of cookie instead of grouping them into functional, statistics, and marketing categories.
4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, this could result in a Complaint as users might feel their privacy is being compromised due to insufficient information about the specific purposes or processing activities carried out by these third parties.
5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without appropriate safeguards, this would be Non-Compliant with GDPR regulations requiring adequate protection of personal data when transferred outside the EU.

Final Justification: The policy partially adheres to GDPR requirements by providing multiple consent options and allowing users to manage their preferences. However, it fails to meet the transparency criteria regarding third-party data sharing.

Suggestions for Improvement: To improve compliance with GDPR, Dräger should provide clear and concise explanations about the specific purposes of data processing carried out by each third-party service mentioned in the policy. Additionally, they could consider implementing granular consent options to meet the regulatory requirements for detailed and explicit user choices. Furthermore, proper safeguards must be implemented when transferring personal data outside the EU to ensure compliance with GDPR regulations."

   Main Compliance Analysis:
   - The policy provides clear information about the use of cookies, their purposes, and data protection rights. It also offers users the option to manage cookie preferences.
   - However, the policy does not clearly distinguish between necessary (essential) cookies and non-necessary (functional, marketing & advertising) cookies as required by GDPR. Moreover, granular consent is not explicitly offered for all types of cookies.
   - The policy does not specify whether third-party vendors have taken appropriate data protection measures to comply with GDPR.

   Counterfactual Impact:
   - If explicit consent was not obtained (e.g., by using necessary cookies as a basis for implied consent), this would be non-compliant with GDPR, potentially leading to fines and loss of user trust.
   - If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, this could also lead to non-compliance, as it infringes on the user's right to do so at any time.
   - Making granular consent mandatory would ensure more transparency and control for users, potentially leading to increased compliance with GDPR.
   - If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, this could lead to non-compliance, as it may infringe on the user's right to know and control their data.
   - Transferring data to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield) would also be non-compliant with GDPR, potentially leading to fines and loss of user trust.

   Final Justification: The policy provides some transparency but does not meet all requirements for GDPR compliance due to lack of granular consent and unclear distinction between necessary and non-necessary cookies.

   Suggestions for Improvement:
   - Offer granular consent for all types of cookies, including essential, functional, marketing & advertising cookies.

The policy also mentions data sharing with third parties but lacks specificity on how such data transfer safeguards are implemented.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. Non-compliance occurs if explicit consent was not obtained for all categories of cookies, as required by GDPR. This could result in fines or legal action.
     2. Inability for users to withdraw consent easily would make it difficult for them to comply with their rights under the GDPR, potentially leading to user dissatisfaction and reputational damage.
     3. Mandatory granular consent would require users to explicitly accept each category of cookie. This may lead to a decrease in website functionality or usability if too many users choose not to accept certain cookies.
     4. Lack of transparency regarding data sharing with third parties could violate GDPR principles, as it fails to inform users about the nature and purpose of such data processing.

However, it lacks explicit consent for non-necessary cookies and does not provide a simple method for users to withdraw their consent once given.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
    1. If explicit consent was not obtained for non-necessary cookies, it would affect compliance as GDPR requires explicit and informed consent for such cookies. This could lead to potential fines or legal action.
    2. If users cannot withdraw their consent easily, the policy would be non-compliant as GDPR mandates that individuals have the right to withdraw their consent at any time.

    1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the website would be in violation of GDPR as it does not provide an easy way for users to refuse non-essential cookies. This could lead to enforcement actions and potential fines.
    2. If users cannot withdraw their consent easily, this would also violate GDPR principles as individuals must have the ability to revoke consent at any time. Non-compliance may result in user distrust, reputational damage, and possible legal consequences.
    3. Mandatory granular consent would necessitate giving users clear and concise information about each individual cookie, along with an option to accept or reject them individually. This would increase transparency and control for users but requires more effort to implement on the website.

   - Main Compliance Analysis: The policy provides some level of transparency regarding the use of cookies, offering users the ability to modify their preferences. However, it does not explicitly state whether or not strict consent is obtained for non-essential cookies (Marketing and Functional categories), which are active by default upon user entry. Additionally, there seems to be no clear option provided for users to easily withdraw their consent once given.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
      1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the policy would be non-compliant as GDPR requires explicit and informed consent for the use of non-essential cookies. This could lead to potential fines or legal action against the organization.
      2. If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, this could also lead to non-compliance with GDPR, as users must be able to revoke their consent at any time. This may impact user trust and potentially result in regulatory penalties.
      3. Mandatory granular consent would make the policy fully compliant, as it allows users to explicitly choose which types of cookies they allow or disallow. However, this may negatively affect usability if too many options are presented to the user at once.
      4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, this could lead to non-compliance with GDPR, as users must be informed about data transfer to third parties and have the ability to opt-out if they choose to do so.
      5. Data transfer to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards would render the policy non-compliant, as GDPR requires adequate protection for personal data transferred outside of the EU.
   - Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR by providing transparency and giving users some control over their cookie preferences. However, it lacks explicit consent for non-essential cookies and does not provide a straightforward method for users to withdraw their consent once given.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To achieve full compliance with GDPR, the policy should be updated to explicitly obtain consent for non-essential cookies, offer users an easy way to revoke their consent at any time, and ensure that data transfers outside of the EU are protected through appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield. Additionally, consider offering granular consent as an option for users who prefer it."

   - Main Compliance Analysis: The cookie policy informs users about the use of cookies and web technologies, provides links to the privacy policy and imprint, and offers an option for users to revoke or adjust their consent settings. However, it does not explicitly state that consent is necessary for non-essential cookies, nor does it provide a clear and easily accessible method for obtaining user consent.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the policy would be Non-Compliant with GDPR as it fails to meet the requirement of obtaining explicit and informed consent from users before setting non-essential cookies. This could lead to potential fines or legal actions.
     2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, this would also be a violation of GDPR as users should have the ability to revoke their consent at any time. This would negatively impact user trust and potentially result in legal consequences.
     3. If granular consent was mandatory, the policy would need to be updated to provide users with clear options for each individual technology being used, rather than just offering an ""Accept All"" or ""Deny All"" option. This would enhance transparency and meet GDPR requirements for obtaining informed consent.
     4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, this would also be a violation of GDPR as users must be clearly informed about the specific third-parties with whom their data will be shared. This lack of transparency could lead to potential fines or legal actions and negatively impact user trust.
     5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards, this would also be a violation of GDPR as appropriate measures (such as the EU Standard Contractual Clauses) must be in place to ensure the protection of users' personal data. This lack of safeguards could lead to potential fines or legal actions and negatively impact user trust.
   - Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it provides some information about the use of cookies and offers users an option to adjust their consent settings. However, it falls short in obtaining explicit consent for non-essential cookies, providing a clear and easily accessible method for obtaining user consent, and being transparent about data sharing with third parties and data transfer to non-EU countries.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To become fully compliant with GDPR, the following action points are suggested:
     1. Update the policy to clearly state that consent is necessary for non-essential cookies.
     2. Provide users with a clear and easily accessible method for obtaining explicit consent before setting non-essential cookies (e.g., using a banner or pop-up).
     3. Offer granular control over individual technologies being used and clearly explain what each technology is used for in the policy.
     4. Be transparent about data sharing with third parties, including the specific third-parties with whom users' personal data will be shared.
     5. Implement appropriate measures to ensure the protection of users' personal data during data transfer to non-EU countries (e.g., using the EU Standard Contractual Clauses)."

   - Main Compliance Analysis: The policy informs users about the use of cookies, provides a mechanism to manage consent preferences, and links to the Privacy Information. However, it does not explicitly mention the purpose of each type of cookie, which is necessary for transparency. Also, it does not provide an easy means for users to withdraw their consent once given.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
    1. Non-Compliance: If explicit consent was not obtained (e.g., by pre-ticking the ""Yes"" box), it would be non-compliant as users' actions should never override their free and active consent.
    2. Impact: If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, they may feel a lack of control over their data, which could lead to mistrust and potential legal consequences.
    3. Non-Compliance: If granular consent was mandatory, the current policy would not meet requirements as it does not allow users to accept or reject individual categories of cookies.
    4. Non-Compliance: If data sharing with third parties is not transparent (i.e., without informing users about specific third parties), this would breach GDPR's transparency principle.
    5. Non-Compliance: Transferring data to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses, Binding Corporate Rules, or the EU-US Privacy Shield violates GDPR.
   - Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR by providing information about cookies and allowing users to manage their preferences. However, it fails to meet requirements regarding transparency, user control, granular consent, and data protection when transferring data to non-EU countries.
   - Suggestions for Improvement:

   - Main Compliance Analysis: The cookie policy provides necessary information about the types of cookies used (essential and statistics) and their functions. However, it lacks explicit consent options for non-essential cookies, a mechanism for easy withdrawal of consent, transparency regarding data sharing with third parties, and clarity on data transfer to non-EU countries.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. Non-obtaining of explicit consent would render the policy non-compliant with GDPR as it requires explicit and informed consent for non-essential cookies. This could result in regulatory fines, loss of user trust, and potential legal action.
     2. If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, the policy would be non-compliant. Users should have the ability to change their preferences at any time, making this a key requirement for GDPR compliance.
     3. Mandatory granular consent would necessitate offering users an option to accept or reject each type of cookie individually, which is currently not provided in this policy. This enhancement would be necessary for full compliance with GDPR.
     4. Lack of transparency about data sharing with third parties means that the policy does not meet the requirements of GDPR for clear communication about data usage and disclosure practices.
     5. Data transfer to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards would be a breach of GDPR, which requires adequate protection of personal data transferred outside the EU.
   - Final Justification: The current policy partially complies with GDPR by providing information about the types of cookies used but falls short in obtaining explicit consent for non-essential cookies, enabling easy withdrawal of consent, being transparent about data sharing, and ensuring appropriate safeguards for international data transfers.

   - Main Compliance Analysis:
      - The policy informs users about the use of cookies, their purpose, and transfers outside the EEA. However, it does not provide a clear distinction between necessary and non-necessary cookies, which is required under GDPR.
      - Users are provided with the option to manage their cookie preferences; thus, consent is not pre-ticked for all cookies. However, the ease of withdrawing consent is not explicitly stated.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
      - If explicit consent was not obtained (counterfactual 1), it would lead to non-compliance with GDPR as users' actions cannot be considered valid consent if they have no genuine choice.
      - If users cannot easily withdraw their consent (counterfactual 2), it may infringe upon user rights and reduce trust, potentially leading to legal issues under GDPR.
      - If granular consent was mandatory (counterfactual 3), the policy would need to separate necessary and non-necessary cookies and provide explicit options for users to consent or reject each category. This would ensure that only the minimal amount of data is collected for the intended purpose.
      - If data sharing with third parties was not transparent (counterfactual 4), it could lead to non-compliance as users should be informed about such activities under GDPR.
      - If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards (counterfactual 5), it would be a breach of GDPR, which requires appropriate safeguards for data transfers outside the EEA.
   - Final Justification: The policy does provide some information about cookies and user consent but lacks clarity in certain areas, potentially leading to non-compliance with GDPR under certain counterfactual scenarios.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To become fully compliant with GDPR, the cookie policy should make it clearer that necessary cookies are always active and provide granular options for users to manage their preferences regarding non-necessary cookies. The policy should also explicitly state how users can withdraw their consent at any time and ensure transparency regarding data sharing with third parties and appropriate safeguards for data transfer outside the EEA."

   - Main Compliance Analysis: The policy provides information about the use of cookies, purpose of usage (analysis, performance, marketing, individual marketing), and user's right to withdraw consent. However, it does not clearly specify the identity of the data controller or provide a way to easily adjust cookie preferences beyond accepting all or rejecting all cookies.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. If explicit consent was not obtained: Non-compliance with GDPR since obtaining user's clear and affirmative consent is mandatory for using cookies that are not strictly necessary. This could lead to enforcement action, fines, and damage to the brand's reputation.
     2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily: Partial non-compliance as it violates the principle of accountability and transparency by making it difficult for users to exercise their rights under GDPR. This may result in user dissatisfaction and potential legal action.
     3. If granular consent was mandatory: Non-compliance since the policy only offers two options (accept all or reject all) instead of providing users with clear choices about which specific cookies they agree to accept.
     4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent: Non-compliance as Article 13(1)(a) and (b) require that the identity of the controller and categories of recipients must be provided in the policy. Lack of transparency could lead to fines and user mistrust.
     5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards: Non-compliance since GDPR requires appropriate safeguards for international data transfers. Without these safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the Privacy Shield framework, data transfers could be considered illegal and lead to fines and legal action.
   - Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements by informing users about cookie usage and their right to withdraw consent. However, it fails to meet GDPR standards in terms of transparency, user control, and data protection when transferring data outside the EU.
   - Suggestions for Improvement:

   Main Compliance Analysis:
   - The policy provides users with options to choose their cookie preferences, which aligns with GDPR requirements for user consent. However, it does not clearly specify whether the 'Accept all' option includes necessary and optional cookies, which may raise concerns about informed consent.
   - The policy allows users to adjust their preferences at any time, demonstrating some level of ability to withdraw consent. However, the ease of this process is not explicitly stated or demonstrated in the text.
   - The policy does not mandate granular consent but offers users the option to 'Set Preferences', which could be seen as a step towards granular consent.
   - Transparency regarding data sharing with third parties is addressed in the policy, but it could benefit from clearer language and examples to make it easier for users to understand.
   - The policy does not specify any measures taken for safe data transfer to non-EU countries, which is a requirement under GDPR.

   Counterfactual Impact:
   1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the policy would be Non-Compliant as it fails to meet one of the fundamental requirements of GDPR.
   2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, this could lead to user dissatisfaction and potential legal consequences, making the policy Partially Compliant.
   3. If granular consent was mandatory, the policy would need significant changes to offer more specific options for users, potentially increasing compliance complexity but improving user control.
   4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, this would render the policy Non-Compliant as it fails to inform users about how their data is being used, a key requirement under GDPR.
   5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards, the policy would be Non-Compliant, as it fails to address an essential aspect of GDPR compliance: ensuring data protection when transferring data outside the EU.

   Final Justification: The Cookie Policy offers users some level of choice and control over their cookie settings, but it lacks clarity in certain areas that are crucial for full GDPR compliance. Improvements should focus on providing clearer language regarding consent, data sharing with third parties, and data transfer to non-EU countries.

   Suggestions for Improvement:
   1. Clearly specify whether the 'Accept all' option includes necessary and optional cookies.
   2. Make it easier for users to adjust their preferences and withdraw their consent.

   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. If explicit consent was not obtained, it would lead to non-compliance with GDPR as user's personal data processing would be unlawful.
     2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, this may result in a breach of GDPR principles, as users should have the right to modify or revoke their choices at any time.
     3. Mandatory granular consent would necessitate offering more detailed and specific options to users, ensuring full transparency about the purposes for which personal data will be processed.
     4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, it would lead to non-compliance since Article 14 requires controllers to provide clear and concise information about the identity of recipients or categories of recipients of personal data.
     5. Data transfer to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses, EU-US Privacy Shield) would violate GDPR principles as it may not provide an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of individuals.

However, it lacks explicit consent for some purposes, does not ensure easy withdrawal of consent, and does not fully meet the requirement for granular consent in all cases.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. If explicit consent was not obtained, this would render the policy non-compliant as per GDPR requirements. Users would have no clear understanding of how their data is being used or the ability to make informed decisions about its use.
     2. If users cannot easily withdraw consent, this would violate the user's right to control their personal data. This could lead to negative public perception and potential fines under GDPR.
     3. If granular consent was mandatory, the current policy does not meet these requirements since some purposes have blanket ""Consent"" options instead of individual consent for each purpose. This would result in non-compliance with GDPR regulations.
     4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, users would be unaware of who is processing their personal data and for what purposes. This lack of transparency could lead to a breach of trust and potential legal issues.
     5. Data transfer to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses or the EU-US Privacy Shield) would be non-compliant with GDPR regulations, as it fails to protect the data subject's rights in those jurisdictions.
   - Final Justification: The policy provides some transparency and control options for users, but it falls short of meeting all requirements under GDPR, particularly concerning explicit consent, easy withdrawal of consent, granular consent, and transparency with third-party data sharing.

   **Main Compliance Analysis:**
   - The policy informs users about the use of cookies, the purpose of processing, and provides an option to either agree or deny. This aligns with Article 12 (1) and (2) of GDPR.
   - There is a provision for modifying settings or withdrawing consent, which meets the requirements of Article 7 (3) GDPR.
   - However, the policy does not clearly distinguish between essential and non-essential cookies, making it difficult for users to make an informed decision. This could potentially violate Article 5 (1) a) GDPR, as users may not fully understand what they are consenting to.
   - The policy lists numerous third parties with which data is shared for marketing & analytics purposes, but does not provide clear transparency about the nature and purpose of this data sharing, which could violate Article 14 (1) a) GDPR.
   - There is no information provided about safeguards for data transfer to non-EU countries, potentially violating Article 46 GDPR.

   **Counterfactual Impact:**
   - If explicit consent was not obtained, it would violate Article 6 (1) a) GDPR and the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency. Users' rights and freedoms could be infringed upon, and the controller could face penalties.
   - If users cannot easily withdraw consent, they may feel that their rights are being violated, potentially leading to user dissatisfaction and loss of trust. This could also result in regulatory issues under Article 7 (3) GDPR.
   - If granular consent was mandatory, it would require users to explicitly agree to each category of cookies used, providing a clearer understanding of what they are consenting to. This aligns more closely with the principle of transparency and may reduce potential violations of Article 5 (1) a) GDPR.
   - If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, users would not have a clear understanding of how their data is being used, which could infringe upon their rights under Article 14 (1) a) GDPR.
   - If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards, it would violate Article 46 GDPR, potentially leading to penalties and loss of user trust.

   **Final Justification:** The policy provides some key information and options for users, but lacks clarity and transparency in certain areas, particularly with regards to the distinction between essential and non-essential cookies and data sharing with third parties.

   **Suggestions for Improvement:** - Clearly distinguish between essential and non-essential cookies, providing a granular approach to consent where possible.
      - Provide clear and concise explanations about the nature and purpose of data sharing with third parties.
      - Ensure transparency regarding data transfer to non-EU countries, including information about any safeguards in place.

   - Main Compliance Analysis:
      - The policy informs users about the types of cookies used and their purpose, which is a requirement under GDPR.
      - The user has the option to accept only essential cookies or all cookies, providing some level of control over data processing.
      - However, explicit consent is not obtained in the cookie banner for non-essential cookies. This is a crucial aspect of GDPR compliance as user consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
      - If explicit consent was not obtained (as currently), it would significantly impact compliance as the lack of clear user consent could result in fines under GDPR.
      - If users cannot withdraw consent easily, it would negatively affect GDPR compliance because users should have the right to revoke their consent at any time.
      - If granular consent was mandatory, it would require more detailed information about each type of cookie and explicit consent for each category, which the current policy does not provide.
      - If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, it would violate GDPR as users must be informed about data processing activities involving third parties.
      - If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards, it would be non-compliant under GDPR as transfers of personal data to countries outside the EU require appropriate safeguards.
   - Final Justification: The current cookie policy provides some information about cookies and allows users to control their consent to a certain extent. However, it falls short of explicitly obtaining user consent for non-essential cookies, which is a critical requirement under GDPR.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To comply fully with GDPR, the following changes should be made:
      - Explicitly obtain user consent for all types of cookies (not just essential ones).
      - Make it easy for users to withdraw their consent at any time.
      - Provide more detailed information about each type of cookie and ensure granular consent is obtained if necessary.

However, it lacks explicit consent for each type of cookie category (strictly necessary, performance, functional, marketing, and targeting), as required by the GDPR.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
      1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the policy would be non-compliant with GDPR regulations as users have not actively agreed to each category of cookies placed on their device.
      2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, this could lead to a breach of transparency and user control over their data, impacting compliance negatively.
      3. Mandatory granular consent would require explicit agreement for each cookie category, making the current policy non-compliant.
      4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, this would violate the principle of transparency under GDPR regulations, potentially leading to non-compliance.
      5. Transferring user data to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield) could result in a breach of GDPR regulations regarding data protection and transfer.
   - Final Justification: The cookie policy provides essential information about cookies but lacks explicit consent for each category, which is necessary under GDPR regulations to ensure user privacy and control over their data.
   - Suggestions for Improvement:
    1. Modify the cookie banner to provide explicit consent for each type of cookie category.
    2. Ensure that users can easily withdraw their consent or modify their settings as required.

counterfactual_scenario,compliant,compliant-5.docx,mistral:latest," Classification: Partially Compliant

   Main Compliance Analysis:
   - The policy provides users with the option to choose between ""Allow all"", ""Only allow necessary"" and ""More options"". This meets one of the GDPR requirements for obtaining explicit consent.
   - Users are informed about the purposes for which their data will be processed and the providers who will process this data. This transparency is essential for GDPR compliance.
   - The policy provides a method for users to withdraw their consent, but it could be improved by making it easier to find and more intuitive.
   - The storage time for the ID used for requesting consent data is not specified, which is necessary for ensuring the data is not stored beyond its necessity.
   - Although users are informed about the use of cookies and technologies, it's not explicitly stated that they can refuse non-essential cookies without impact on website functionality (e.g., necessary cookies cannot be disabled). This could potentially lead to a lack of explicit consent for these cookies.

   Counterfactual Impact:
   1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the policy would be Non-Compliant with GDPR since it's a requirement under Article 6 for processing personal data. The consequences may include administrative fines and damage to reputation.
   2. If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, this could potentially lead to a lack of transparency, which is a core principle under GDPR. This might result in complaints or legal action.
   3. If granular consent was mandatory, the current policy would need to be updated to allow users to individually select each purpose and provider. The benefits would be increased user control over their data and enhanced privacy protection.
   4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, this would result in a Non-Compliant situation since Article 14 requires that individuals receive information about the recipients or categories of recipients of their personal data.
   5. Without appropriate safeguards for transferring data to non-EU countries, the policy would be Non-Compliant with GDPR, potentially leading to fines and reputational damage.

   Final Justification: The current cookie policy partially complies with GDPR due to its transparency and provision of choices. However, improvements are needed in areas such as explicit consent for non-essential cookies and specifying the storage time for consent data.

   Suggestions for Improvement:
   - Clearly state that users can refuse non-essential cookies without impact on website functionality.
   - Specify the storage time for the ID used for requesting consent data.
   - Make it easier for users to find and withdraw their consent, if they choose to do so.
   - Consider updating the policy to meet granular consent requirements, if this is feasible from a technical perspective.
   - Ensure that information about third-party data recipients is provided transparently.
   - Implement appropriate safeguards when transferring data to non-EU countries."

   - Main Compliance Analysis: The policy informs users about the use of cookies, data processing purposes, and provides an option for explicit consent. However, it lacks transparency regarding specific cookies used, their purpose, and duration. Moreover, the opt-out mechanism could be improved as it does not provide easy access to revoke consent once given.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the policy would be non-compliant since GDPR requires clear and affirmative actions for obtaining user's consent.
     2. If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, it would affect compliance as the principle of ""easiness"" in withdrawal is an essential requirement for valid consent under GDPR.
     3. Mandatory granular consent would make the policy non-compliant because the current opt-in/opt-out mechanism does not provide separate consents for each purpose, which is required for granular consent.
     4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, it would be a compliance issue as users should have clear information about who their data will be shared with and for what purposes.
     5. Data transfer to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards would render the policy non-compliant since GDPR mandates the use of adequate safeguards for transfers outside the EU.
   - Final Justification: The current cookie policy does not fully comply with GDPR requirements due to a lack of transparency, insufficient opt-out mechanism, and potential data transfer issues.
   - Suggestions for Improvement:
    1. Provide a clear list of cookies used, their purpose, and duration.
    2. Simplify the opt-out mechanism by making it easily accessible and allowing users to withdraw consent without having to search through multiple settings.
    3. Implement granular consent, providing separate options for analytics, marketing, and other purposes.
    4. Clearly state any data sharing with third parties and ensure transparency about their identities, purposes, and GDPR compliance.

   - Main Compliance Analysis: The cookie policy provides users with options to accept, decline or customize their preferences. However, it does not offer a clear and easily accessible way for users to withdraw consent at any time. Additionally, the data processing partners list could be more transparent about the specific purposes for which personal data is being processed.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. If explicit consent was not obtained, it would result in non-compliance with GDPR as informed and unambiguous consent must be given before storing or accessing cookies on users' devices.
     2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, this counteract the GDPR principle of transparency and control. Users should be able to revoke their consent at any time, which is crucial for maintaining trust and ensuring compliance.
     3. If granular consent was mandatory, the current policy would not meet the requirement as it does not provide a granular approach for users to choose specific categories or services. This could lead to potential non-compliance with GDPR, especially regarding the use of third parties or data transfers outside the EU/EEA.
     4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, this would violate GDPR's transparency requirement as users should be informed about the specific purposes for which their personal data is being shared and the identities of the third parties involved.
     5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards, it could lead to legal risks such as access by government authorities or difficulties in enforcing data protection rights. This would not comply with GDPR, which requires appropriate safeguards for cross-border data transfers.
   - Final Justification: The cookie policy offers some options for users but does not meet all the GDPR requirements regarding consent management, transparency, and control over personal data.
   - Suggestions for Improvement:
     1. Implement an easy-to-find mechanism for users to withdraw their consent at any time.
     2. Provide a more transparent list of third parties involved in data processing, including specific purposes for data sharing.
     3. Offer granular control options for users to choose which categories or services they consent to.

   - International Data Transfer: The notice about data processing in the USA is provided, but it does not specify whether appropriate safeguards are in place. [Unclear]

   Counterfactual Impact:
   1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the lack of valid consent would make any processing of personal data illegal under GDPR.
   2. If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, this could lead to non-compliance as it infringes on the user's right to access and control their data.
   3. If granular consent was mandatory, the policy may need to be updated to provide clear options for each category of cookie.
   4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, users would have no way of knowing how their data is being used, which is a violation of GDPR principles.

   Main Compliance Analysis: The policy informs users about the use of cookies, explains the purpose of each category, and provides a mechanism for managing cookie preferences. However, it lacks transparency in disclosing data sharing with third parties, and the large number of marketing cookies may exceed what is necessary for personalized advertising.

   Counterfactual Impact:
   1. Non-compliance due to the absence of explicit consent would make the policy non-compliant with GDPR as users must actively grant consent before setting any non-essential cookies.
   2. Difficulty in withdrawing consent easily could potentially lead to complaints and fines under GDPR, which prioritizes user control over their data.
   3. Mandatory granular consent would require more explicit permission from users for each category of cookie. This could result in improved transparency but may also increase friction and potentially lower conversion rates if too many prompts are presented to the user.
   4. Lack of transparency in data sharing with third parties would make the policy non-compliant, as GDPR requires disclosure of any data processing activities involving third parties.
   5. Transferring user data to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield) would lead to non-compliance with GDPR and potential legal consequences.

   Final Justification: The policy provides a basic foundation for cookie consent but requires improvements in terms of transparency, granularity, user control, and compliance with data protection regulations regarding third parties and international data transfer.

   Suggestions for Improvement:
   1. Obtain explicit consent from users before setting any non-essential cookies.
   2. Make it easier for users to withdraw their consent at any time.

Main Compliance Analysis:
- The policy informs users about the use of cookies and provides options to accept or reject them, which is a key requirement under GDPR. However, not all cookies are essential, as statistics and marketing cookies can be blocked.
- The policy mentions that users can revoke consent at any time, but it does not specify how easy it is to do so or where this option is located (e.g., a clear link in the footer).
- The policy provides granular control over data processing purposes and providers through the ""More Options"" section, but it is not immediately apparent to users that this level of control exists.
- Transparency is provided regarding the use of third-party cookies and their associated purposes (statistics and marketing), but the specific details about data sharing with these partners are not clearly disclosed.
- The policy does not address data transfers to non-EU countries, so it remains unclear whether adequate safeguards are in place for such transfers.

Counterfactual Impact:
1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the policy would be Non-Compliant because GDPR requires that users provide a clear and affirmative action to give their consent for data processing.
2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, it could lead to a violation of user rights under GDPR as they may not be able to exercise their opt-out option in a timely manner.
3. Making granular consent mandatory would bring the policy into compliance as it aligns with GDPR's emphasis on transparency and control for users over their data.
4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, it could result in a lack of user trust and potential non-compliance with GDPR requirements regarding clear and concise communication about data processing activities.
5. Data transfer to non-EU countries without safeguards would render the policy Non-Compliant as GDPR stipulates that appropriate measures should be taken for such transfers (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses, Binding Corporate Rules).

Final Justification: The current policy partially complies with GDPR as it provides options for users to manage their cookie preferences and informs them about the data processing purposes. However, it lacks clarity on certain aspects such as easy withdrawal of consent and transparency regarding third-party data sharing.

Suggestions for Improvement:
- Make it easier for users to withdraw consent by providing a clear link in the footer or header of the website.
- Clearly disclose specific details about data sharing with third parties in the cookie policy.

It also mentions that the data subject's explicit consent is required under Article 49 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a GDPR if non-essential cookies are accepted.
- However, the policy does not explicitly state how essential cookies are necessary for the website to function, which could be unclear to users. Additionally, it fails to provide an easy and simple way to withdraw consent once given, only mentioning that users can access their cookie settings at any time via the Cookie Policy.
- The policy also warns users about potential data transfer to the USA when they accept non-essential cookies but does not specify if adequate safeguards are in place for such transfers, which is a requirement under GDPR.

Counterfactual Impact:
1. If explicit consent was not obtained, it would make the policy non-compliant with GDPR as it requires explicit and informed consent for the use of cookies. This could lead to potential fines and loss of user trust.
2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, it would affect compliance as the GDPR requires that data subjects should be able to withdraw their consent at any time. This could also lead to decreased user engagement and trust.
3. If granular consent was mandatory, the policy would need to provide more detailed information about each type of cookie and its purpose, making the process of giving consent more complex but ultimately ensuring a higher level of transparency and control for users.
4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, it would be non-compliant as GDPR requires clear communication regarding any such sharing. This could lead to potential fines, loss of user trust, and legal issues.
5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards, it would be non-compliant with GDPR as such transfers require appropriate safeguards to ensure the protection of personal data. This could lead to potential fines, loss of user trust, and legal issues.

Main Compliance Analysis:
- The policy provides information about the use of cookies and offers users the ability to manage their preferences. This is a key requirement under GDPR Article 5(1)(a) for transparency.
- The options to accept or reject all cookies, as well as customizing preferences, meets the requirement for explicit consent. However, it's not clear if necessary cookies are set before users give their consent. (Partial compliance)
- The policy does provide some detail about the types of cookies used and their purposes, but could benefit from more specific information about each cookie, particularly third-party cookies. This level of granularity is recommended under GDPR for informed consent. (Partial compliance)
- Users can withdraw their consent by changing their preferences at any time. This meets the requirement for easy withdrawal of consent. (Compliant)
- Data sharing with third parties and data transfer to non-EU countries are not explicitly mentioned in the policy. This could potentially violate GDPR principles, especially since EU regulations require adequate safeguards for international transfers. (Non-compliant)

Counterfactual Impact:
1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the lack of consent would mean that non-essential cookies cannot be set. This would impact website performance and user experience, as some features may not function properly or be available. It could also lead to legal consequences, such as fines for non-compliance with GDPR.
2. If users cannot withdraw their consent easily, they might perceive the website as intrusive and potentially leave it. This could negatively impact user engagement, brand reputation, and ultimately, conversions or sales.
3. Mandatory granular consent would require users to explicitly agree to each type of cookie, offering more specific information about each cookie. This would likely result in a lengthy process for users and may cause some frustration. However, it could also lead to increased trust and transparency, which could ultimately improve the user experience and overall engagement with the website.
4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, users might be uncomfortable with their data being shared without knowing who it's being shared with or for what purpose. This could negatively impact trust, brand reputation, and user engagement.
5. Data transfer to non-EU countries without safeguards would violate GDPR regulations and could result in legal consequences, such as fines and damage to the company's reputation.

Final Justification: The policy offers users the ability to manage their cookie preferences and provides transparency about the use of cookies.

3. Compliance Change: Mandating granular consent would require the policy to offer more specific options for users to choose from rather than just three broad categories.
4. Impact: Not being transparent about data sharing with third parties could result in a lack of trust from users and potential fines under GDPR.
5. Impact: Transferring data to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards would breach the GDPR, leading to potential legal action, fines, or damage to the organization's reputation.

Final Justification: The policy does provide some necessary information and options for users to manage their consent. However, it falls short in several areas, such as providing details on data retention periods, safeguards when transferring data outside the EU, and transparency about third-party partners. These issues must be addressed for full compliance with GDPR.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Include information about data retention periods in the policy.
2. List all third-party partners to increase transparency.
3. Provide details about the safeguards in place when transferring data outside the EU.
4. Offer more granular consent options to users.
5. Make it easy for users to access, update, or delete their cookie preferences at any time."

Main Compliance Analysis:
- The policy provides options for users to accept or reject cookies, with the ""Reject All"" option being explicitly available. This aligns with GDPR requirements.
- However, the ""One-Click Opt-In"" option grants full consent to all cookies and tracking, which may not always be in line with GDPR's requirement for granular consent.
- The policy also allows users to withdraw consent easily, as they can adjust their settings at any time.
- The policy is transparent about the use of necessary cookies but requires explicit consent for analysis, marketing, and social network cookies, which is compliant.
- There is a section on data sharing with third parties, but it's not clear if this includes all partners mentioned in the policy. This could potentially be non-compliant.
- The policy does not explicitly mention safeguards for data transfer to non-EU countries, which would be a concern under GDPR.

Counterfactual Impact:
1. If explicit consent was not obtained, it would make the policy Non-Compliant as GDPR requires explicit and unambiguous consent from users.
2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, it would negatively impact compliance as one of the core principles of GDPR is giving users control over their data.
3. If granular consent was mandatory, the current ""One-Click Opt-In"" option would not comply, and the policy would need to offer more granular options for users.
4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, it could lead to Non-Compliance as GDPR requires clear information about how personal data is shared.
5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards, it would make the policy Non-Compliant as GDPR requires appropriate safeguards for such transfers.

Final Justification: While the policy does provide some elements of compliance with GDPR, it is not fully compliant due to issues regarding granular consent and data sharing transparency.

Suggestions for Improvement: The Vodafone website should offer more granular options for users to give their consent and clearly disclose all third-party partners that might receive user data. Additionally, the policy should explicitly state any safeguards used for transferring personal data outside the EU."

   Main Compliance Analysis:
   - The policy provides information about the use of cookies, their purpose, and the option to manage preferences. However, it lacks an option for users to refuse all cookies (opt-out), which is required by GDPR.
   - The privacy statement does not offer an opt-out option, which is a violation of GDPR requirements.
   - Users can manage their consent preferences, but the ease of withdrawal of consent is not explicitly stated or demonstrated in the policy.
   - Although categories of cookies are mentioned, transparency regarding data sharing with third parties is not provided, which is essential for GDPR compliance.
   - There is no clear mention of safeguards for data transfer to non-EU countries, which could potentially lead to non-compliance issues.

   Counterfactual Impact:
   1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the policy would be Non-Compliant as per GDPR requirements. The impact would be significant, potentially leading to fines and damage to reputation.
   2. If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, the policy would remain Partially Compliant. The impact could include legal actions, loss of user trust, and potential fines.
   3. If granular consent was mandatory, the policy would need significant modifications to meet this requirement. The impact would be an improved user experience as users would have more control over their data.
   4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, the policy would be Non-Compliant, potentially leading to fines and damage to reputation.
   5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards, the policy would be Non-Compliant, leading to potential legal actions and penalties.

   Final Justification: The policy provides some information about cookies but falls short in several key areas required for GDPR compliance, primarily the lack of an opt-out option and transparency regarding data sharing with third parties.

   - Main Compliance Analysis: The policy provides clear choices for users and discloses the use of cookies, but it does not meet all GDPR requirements. For instance, it lacks transparency regarding third-party data sharing, and it does not provide mechanisms to obtain and manage user consent in a granular manner.

   - Counterfactual Impact:
    1. Non-compliance with obtaining explicit consent: This would make the policy non-compliant, potentially leading to fines or legal challenges from data protection authorities.
    2. Difficulty for users to withdraw consent easily: While the user can modify their preferences in the cookie settings, there is no immediate and easy way to revoke previously given consent. This could be considered non-compliance with GDPR's requirement for simple and accessible means to withdraw consent.
    3. Mandatory granular consent: Requiring users to accept or reject individual types of cookies would make the policy compliant, as it allows users to make informed decisions about their data usage.
    4. Opaque third-party data sharing: By not disclosing specific third parties with whom data is shared and failing to describe the safeguards in place for such transfers, the policy may be non-compliant with GDPR's requirements for transparency regarding data processing activities.
    5. Data transfer to non-EU countries without safeguards: The use of cookies stored in LinkedIn USA raises concerns about data protection, as the United States does not have an adequacy decision from the European Commission. Without providing information on the safeguards employed for these transfers (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield), the policy could be considered non-compliant with GDPR's requirements for ensuring adequate data protection.

   - Final Justification: The current policy is partially compliant, as it provides some level of control to users and discloses the use of cookies. However, it lacks transparency regarding third-party data sharing and fails to provide mechanisms for easily obtaining and managing user consent in a granular manner.

It also separates necessary and optional cookies, which is a GDPR-compliant practice. However, the policy lacks transparency regarding data sharing with third parties, data transfer to non-EU countries, and specifics about user rights (e.g., access, erasure, rectification).
   - Counterfactual Impact:
    1. Non-Compliance Scenario: If explicit consent was not obtained, it would result in a violation of GDPR principles as users have the right to be informed and give their consent. This could lead to potential fines or sanctions.
    2. Users cannot withdraw consent easily: In this case, the policy does not provide a simple way for users to manage or modify their cookie preferences at any time. This would negatively impact users' rights and could lead to complaints and potential legal action.
    3. Granular consent is mandatory: If granular consent was required for each type of cookie, the user experience might become complex and confusing. However, providing this level of detail can help build trust with users and ensure they have a clear understanding of how their data is being used.
    4. Data sharing with third parties was not transparent: The policy should disclose any data sharing practices with third parties. Failing to do so could result in non-compliance and potential fines under GDPR.
    5. Data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards: If personal data is transferred outside of the EU without appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses, Privacy Shield), it would violate GDPR rules, potentially leading to sanctions and reputational damage.
   - Final Justification: The policy does provide users with choices regarding cookies and separates necessary and optional cookies, but it falls short on transparency, detailing user rights, data sharing practices, and the handling of data transfer outside the EU.

   - Main Compliance Analysis: The cookie policy provides a clear summary of the purpose of cookies, offers choices for consent management, and provides information on how to configure privacy preferences. However, it lacks transparency regarding data sharing with third parties and does not explicitly state if data is transferred to non-EU countries without safeguards.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the cookie policy would be Non-Compliant as GDPR requires unambiguous and specific consent from users for any processing activities. This lack of consent could lead to fines and potential lawsuits.
     2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, this would negatively impact compliance as users should have the right to withdraw their consent at any time. Making this process difficult or ambiguous could result in complaints and potential regulatory action.
     3. If granular consent was mandatory, the current policy would need to be updated to provide separate options for each category of cookie (performance & analytics, marketing & personalization, etc.). This would allow users to choose precisely which cookies they want to accept or decline, enhancing their control over their data.
     4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, the cookie policy would be Non-Compliant as GDPR requires controllers to be clear and concise about data sharing activities. This lack of transparency could lead to user distrust and potential legal action.
     5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards, this would be a significant compliance issue as GDPR restricts the transfer of personal data outside the EU unless adequate safeguards are in place. Without these safeguards, the controller could face fines and potential legal action.
   - Final Justification: The cookie policy is Partially Compliant because it offers choices for consent management and provides information on how to configure privacy preferences. However, it lacks transparency regarding data sharing with third parties and does not explicitly state if data is transferred to non-EU countries without safeguards.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To achieve full compliance, the cookie policy should be updated to include explicit information about data sharing with third parties (Google in this case) and provide clear statements regarding data transfers to non-EU countries and any applicable safeguards. Additionally, granular consent options should be added for each category of cookie to give users more control over their data.

   Main Compliance Analysis:
   - The policy provides clear information about the use of cookies, their purposes, and user choices.
   - Users are given multiple options for consent (necessary only, selection, all cookies).
   - The policy explains that users can change their preferences at any time.
   - However, it lacks transparency regarding data sharing with third parties in the Marketing Cookies section.

   Counterfactual Impact:
   1. Non-Compliance Scenario: If explicit consent was not obtained, it would be non-compliant with GDPR as users should always have control over their personal data and must actively agree to its processing.
   2. Impact of Not Being Able to Withdraw Consent Easily: Violation of GDPR as users should have the right to withdraw their consent easily at any time, which is not ensured in this policy if there are no straightforward instructions provided for withdrawal.
   3. Mandatory Granular Consent Scenario: If granular consent was mandatory, the current policy would be partially compliant because it already provides multiple options for user consent, but it still lacks transparency about data sharing with third parties in the Marketing Cookies section.
   4. Data Sharing Transparency Scenario: If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, this would be non-compliant with GDPR as users must be informed and have the right to object to such sharing if they wish.
   5. Non-EU Data Transfer Scenario: If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without appropriate safeguards, this would be non-compliant with GDPR as transfers outside of the EU should only happen when there are adequate safeguards in place (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield).

   Final Justification: The policy provides some level of compliance by informing users about cookie usage and offering choices for consent, but it is not fully compliant because it does not offer full transparency regarding data sharing with third parties.

   Suggestions for Improvement:
   - Clearly state in the Marketing Cookies section whether or not user data will be shared with third-party partners and provide information about how users can object to such sharing if they wish.
   - Ensure that users are able to easily withdraw their consent at any time, providing clear instructions on how to do so.

   - The policy does not specify whether appropriate safeguards are in place for transferring personal data to non-EU countries.

   Counterfactual Impact:
   1. If explicit consent was not obtained, it would render the policy non-compliant with GDPR, as it requires a clear affirmative action from users (Article 6).
   2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, it would affect compliance by failing to meet the requirement for providing clear and concise mechanisms to manage preferences (Article 7).
   3. If granular consent was mandatory, the current policy would need to be updated to offer the option of selectively accepting or refusing specific categories of cookies.
   4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, it would compromise compliance by failing to meet the requirement for transparency about recipients of personal data (Article 14).
   5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards, it would jeopardize compliance by potentially violating the principle of ensuring adequate protection (Article 46).

   Final Justification: While the policy discloses the use of cookies and provides links to additional information, it falls short in several areas regarding GDPR compliance, particularly in obtaining explicit consent, providing easy ways for users to withdraw their consent or manage preferences, offering granular consent, ensuring transparency about third-party data processing, and specifying appropriate safeguards for transferring personal data to non-EU countries.

   Suggestions for Improvement:
   - Update the policy to obtain explicit consent before setting non-essential cookies.

- The ability to withdraw consent is provided via a link, but it's unclear if individual consent settings can be easily revoked or changed at any time.
- Although granular consent is not currently enforced, users are offered the option to configure their preferences individually. This may be sufficient for partial compliance under certain interpretations of GDPR guidelines.
- Third-party data sharing with services using cookies is disclosed, which is compliant. However, no mention of safeguards for international data transfers is made.
- No information about data transfer to non-EU countries is provided in the policy text.

Counterfactual Impact:
1. If explicit consent was not obtained (e.g., by using pre-ticked boxes), it would be non-compliant as users would not actively agree to the processing of their personal data.
2. If users cannot easily withdraw or change their consent, this could lead to a lack of trust and potential legal challenges.
3. Mandating granular consent would require offering more options for individual preference configurations and ensuring all necessary information is provided about each type of cookie.
4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, it could be considered non-compliant as users would not be fully informed about the processing of their personal data.

      - The policy provides information about the use of cookies, the purpose, and the option to revoke consent. This is in line with GDPR requirements.
      - However, it does not clearly distinguish between essential (necessary for website functionality) and non-essential cookies, which are subject to user consent.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
      - 1. If explicit consent was not obtained: Non-compliance as the GDPR requires explicit, informed, and unambiguous consent. This could lead to potential fines or legal action.
      - 2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily: Partial non-compliance. While it is possible to revoke consent, making this process difficult for users would go against GDPR principles of transparency and user control over their data.
      - 3. If granular consent was mandatory: Compliance would increase significantly as users would be able to choose which specific cookies they accept. However, the current policy does not provide this level of detail.
      - 4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent: Non-compliance as the GDPR requires clear and concise information about data sharing practices with third parties.
      - 5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards: Non-compliance as the GDPR requires appropriate safeguards for data transfers outside the EU.
   - Final Justification: The policy provides some essential elements of a compliant cookie policy but falls short in several key areas, particularly in terms of transparency and user control.
   - Suggestions for Improvement:
      - Clearly distinguish between essential and non-essential cookies.
      - Provide granular consent options for users.
      - Transparently disclose data sharing practices with third parties.
      - Ensure appropriate safeguards for any data transfers outside the EU."

   Main Compliance Analysis:
   - The policy provides clear information about the purposes of processing, types of cookies used (essential, marketing, statistics, personalized ads), and third-party partners involved in data processing.
   - Users are given the option to adjust their consent settings.
   - The storage period of cookies and users' right to withdraw consent at any time is mentioned in the Privacy Policy.
   - However, pre-ticked consent options for marketing, statistics, and personalized ads may not meet GDPR standards for granular consent.

   Counterfactual Impact:
   1. If explicit consent was not obtained: Non-compliance with GDPR as explicit consent is a requirement under Article 6(1)(a) and Recital 32 of the GDPR.
   2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily: Non-compliance as per Article 7(3) and Article 12(2) of the GDPR, which emphasize the right to withdraw consent and the obligation to inform users about their right to do so.
   3. If granular consent was mandatory: The current policy would be non-compliant as the pre-ticked options do not meet the requirement for granular consent.
   4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent: Non-compliance due to lack of transparency and failure to meet the accountability principle under GDPR.
   5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards: Potential non-compliance as Article 44 of the GDPR stipulates that personal data should not be transferred to a third country or an international organization unless it ensures an adequate level of protection.

   Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR, but improvements are necessary regarding granular consent, transparency in data sharing with third parties, and data transfer safeguards.

   Suggestions for Improvement:
   1. Remove pre-ticked options to ensure granular consent is obtained.
   2. Ensure transparency by disclosing all third-party partners involved in data processing and their roles.
   3. Implement appropriate safeguards for data transfers to non-EU countries, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework.
   4. Review and update the policy to ensure full compliance with GDPR principles."

   - Main Compliance Analysis: The policy provides information about cookies, includes a link to the privacy policy, and allows users to manage their cookie settings. However, it lacks transparency in disclosing data sharing with third parties and does not explicitly state if and how data is transferred to non-EU countries without adequate safeguards.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
      1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the policy would not be compliant with GDPR, as it only provides an option to 'Accept all cookies' upon visiting the website without a clear indication of which cookies are essential and non-essential. This could potentially infringe on users' rights under Article 7 of the GDPR.
      2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, this would negatively impact compliance as it contradicts Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR, which emphasizes that consent must be ""as easy to withdraw as to give.""
      3. Mandatory granular consent would likely require significant changes to the current policy, as it would necessitate explicit consent for each category and service listed. This could make the user experience more complex but aligns with the GDPR's goal of increased transparency and control.
      4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, this would lead to non-compliance under Articles 12-14 of the GDPR, which stipulate that individuals have the right to be informed about their personal data processing.
      5. Data transfer to non-EU countries without safeguards would result in non-compliance with Article 44 of the GDPR, as it does not specify how such transfers are ensured to provide an adequate level of protection for users' data.
   - Final Justification: The policy fails to meet all requirements of the GDPR, as it lacks clarity about data sharing with third parties and data transfer to non-EU countries without safeguards. However, it does allow users to manage their cookie settings and provides information about cookies and the privacy policy.
   - Suggestions for Improvement:
      1. Explicitly state which cookies are essential and non-essential, and obtain explicit consent for each category and service listed in the ""Privacy Settings.""
      2. Clearly disclose data sharing with third parties and provide information about any transfers of personal data to countries outside the EU, including details on the safeguards implemented.

   Main Compliance Analysis:
   - The cookie policy provides information about the use of cookies, including essential, functional, and marketing categories. It also informs users about data processing in the USA and offers an option to change settings at any time.
   - However, explicit consent is not obtained before the collection and processing of personal data; instead, it is assumed that by continuing to browse the site after clicking ""Accept all"", users have given their consent. This falls short of GDPR requirements for clear and affirmative action to obtain consent.
   - The process for withdrawing consent is accessible, but there's no mention if it will prevent future data collection, which is a requirement under GDPR.
   - Granular consent is offered, but not strictly mandatory, which may be seen as an optional feature rather than a necessity under the GDPR.
   - Transparency regarding data sharing with third parties is provided, although it could be improved by explicitly listing all the third-party service providers and their purposes for processing personal data.
   - The policy does not specify any measures in place to ensure adequate safeguards when transferring data to non-EU countries (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield certification).

Counterfactual Impact:
1. Not obtaining explicit consent would lead to a breach of the GDPR, potentially resulting in fines and damage to reputation.
2. If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, it violates their rights under the GDPR, causing user dissatisfaction and potential legal repercussions.
3. Making granular consent mandatory would help ensure that users are fully informed about the data being collected and processed, thus increasing transparency and compliance with the GDPR.
4. Not clearly disclosing data sharing with third parties could result in unauthorized processing of personal data, causing privacy concerns and potential legal issues.
5. Transferring data to non-EU countries without adequate safeguards would violate GDPR principles, exposing the company to legal action and damage to its reputation.

Final Justification: The cookie policy provides some level of transparency and offers users an option to change their settings; however, it does not meet all the requirements for GDPR compliance due to the lack of explicit consent, clear data sharing disclosures, and adequate protection for international data transfer.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Modify the policy to obtain explicit consent before collecting and processing personal data.
2. Provide clear information about third-party service providers and their purposes for processing personal data.
3. Ensure that users can easily withdraw their consent, and this withdrawal will prevent future data collection.
4. Implement adequate safeguards when transferring data to non-EU countries (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield certification)."

However, it lacks explicit consent obtained upon the first visit, easy withdrawal of consent, granular consent options for all types of cookies, and transparency regarding third-party data sharing.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. If explicit consent was not obtained, it would render the policy non-compliant with GDPR, as users should be asked for their consent upon the first visit.
     2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, it would violate the right to withdraw consent at any time, as required by GDPR.
     3. Mandatory granular consent would require a more detailed and individualized approach to obtain explicit permission for each category of cookies. The current policy only offers this option after acceptance.
     4. Lack of transparency regarding third-party data sharing could lead to non-compliance, as users should be informed about the specific parties with whom their data will be shared.
     5. Transferring data to non-EU countries without adequate safeguards would not comply with GDPR regulations that ensure an appropriate level of protection for personal data.
   - Final Justification: The policy fails to meet several GDPR requirements, such as obtaining explicit consent upon the first visit and providing easy withdrawal of consent, granular consent options, transparency about third-party data sharing, and adequate safeguards for data transfer outside the EU.
   - Suggestions for Improvement:
     1. Implement a system to obtain explicit consent upon the first visit.
     2. Allow users to easily withdraw their consent at any time.
     3. Offer granular consent options for all categories of cookies, not just functional and targeting cookies.
     4. Clearly state which third parties will have access to user data.

   - Main Compliance Analysis: The policy provides information about the use of cookies, offers users the ability to manage cookie settings, and mentions a privacy policy. However, it lacks clarity on whether explicit consent was obtained for non-essential cookies and fails to provide sufficient information about data transfer to third parties or non-EU countries.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     - If explicit consent was not obtained, the policy would be Non-Compliant with GDPR as it is required to obtain user's clear and affirmative consent for non-essential cookies.
     - If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, the policy would be partially compliant because users should have the ability to manage cookie settings at any time. However, ease of withdrawal can affect user trust and potential future interactions with the website.
     - If granular consent was mandatory, the policy would need to be updated to allow users to select specific categories of cookies they agree or disagree with, rather than having only an ""Accept all"" option.
     - If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, the policy would be Non-Compliant as GDPR requires clear and concise information about third-party data recipients.
     - If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards, the policy would be Non-Compliant because transferring personal data outside of the EU must comply with appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) or the EU-US Privacy Shield.
   - Final Justification: The policy does not fully meet GDPR requirements for transparency, user control, and explicit consent regarding non-essential cookies, data transfer to third parties, and transfer of personal data outside of the EU.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: Include clear language about obtaining explicit consent for non-essential cookies, provide information about data sharing with third parties and ensure compliance with GDPR safeguards for international transfers, offer granular consent options for users, and make it easy for users to manage their cookie settings at any time."

   Main Compliance Analysis:
   - The policy informs users about the use of cookies and web technologies, explains their purposes, and provides options for consent. However, it does not clearly state that the user's continued browsing constitutes consent under GDPR (implied consent). This means the policy lacks clarity regarding the default setting (accept all or deny all).
   - Users can adjust or withdraw their consent via ""Individual Settings."" However, the ability to easily withdraw consent is not immediately apparent from the initial policy presentation.
   - Granular consent is partially addressed by the ""Individual Settings"" option. It's not mandatory but optional, which may not align with the GDPR's spirit of giving individuals full control over their data.
   - Data sharing with third parties is mentioned and linked to further information, although clarity could be improved by listing specific partners in the policy itself.
   - Data transfer to non-EU countries is not explicitly addressed.

   Counterfactual Impact:
   - If explicit consent was not obtained (either by default or through user action), it would render the policy non-compliant, potentially leading to fines and loss of user trust.
   - If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, it could lead to complaints and potential legal issues, as well as damage to reputation due to user dissatisfaction.
   - Mandatory granular consent would require more effort from the user, potentially decreasing usability and increasing the risk of non-compliance if implemented incorrectly.
   - If data sharing with third parties was not transparent or not mentioned at all, it could lead to non-compliance and potential data breaches, damaging user trust.
   - Transferring data to non-EU countries without safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield) would be a clear violation of GDPR, leading to severe penalties.

   Final Justification: The policy provides some information and options for consent but lacks clarity in crucial areas such as default consent setting and data transfer. Additional transparency regarding third-party partners and data transfer practices is necessary for full compliance.

   Suggestions for Improvement:
   - Clarify the default consent setting, making it clear whether continued browsing constitutes acceptance or if explicit action is required.
   - Make it more apparent that users can easily withdraw their consent from the initial policy presentation.
   - Consider implementing mandatory granular consent to align with GDPR's intent of giving individuals control over their data.
   - Clearly list specific third-party partners in the policy itself, providing transparency regarding data sharing practices.

However, it lacks specificity regarding third-party cookies, data transfer outside the EU, and a clear mechanism for users to easily withdraw consent.

   - Counterfactual Impact:
      - If explicit consent was not obtained, it would result in non-compliance as GDPR requires explicit and informed consent. Users should be presented with a banner requesting their consent when they first visit the website.
      - If users cannot withdraw consent easily, this would negatively impact compliance as GDPR gives individuals the right to withdraw their consent at any time. The policy needs to include a simple and accessible way for users to revoke their consent if needed.
      - Granular consent being mandatory would improve compliance, as it ensures that users are aware of and can choose which types of cookies they accept. This level of detail is not currently provided in the policy.
      - If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, it would lead to non-compliance as GDPR requires clear communication about data processing activities, including any sharing with third parties. The policy should specify which cookies are shared with third parties and for what purpose.
      - Data transfer to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards would be a breach of GDPR, as it may not provide adequate protection for the personal data being transferred.

Main Compliance Analysis:
- The policy informs users about the use of cookies and provides a way to manage their preferences, which aligns with GDPR requirements. However, it does not explicitly obtain user consent before setting non-essential cookies, which is a crucial aspect of GDPR compliance.
- Users can adjust their cookie preferences, but the process for withdrawing consent is not easily accessible or clearly explained, which could potentially breach GDPR's requirement for clear and easy withdrawal.
- The policy does not seem to mandate granular consent for each type of cookie, although this level of detail would be more in line with GDPR's expectation for transparency and control over personal data.
- Data sharing with third parties is mentioned, but the specific details about these parties or any safeguards in place are not provided, which could raise concerns under GDPR.
- The policy does indicate that data may be transferred outside the EEA, but it does not specify if appropriate safeguards have been implemented, which is a requirement under GDPR.

Counterfactual Impact:
1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the policy would be non-compliant as this is a fundamental requirement under GDPR. This could result in potential fines and loss of user trust.
2. If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, this would compromise the principle of transparency and control expected by GDPR. Users may choose to abandon the site due to lack of confidence in how their data is being handled.
3. Mandatory granular consent would require a more detailed and involved process for managing cookie preferences, potentially improving user trust but increasing complexity in the process.
4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, it could lead to breaches of GDPR's principles on fairness, transparency, and accountability. This lack of transparency may negatively impact user trust and potentially result in regulatory action.
5. Transferring personal data to non-EU countries without safeguards would violate the GDPR's requirements for protecting EU citizens' data, leading to potential fines and loss of user confidence.

   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. If explicit consent was not obtained, it would be a breach of GDPR as it requires user's active and informed agreement for processing their personal data. This could lead to fines and damage to the company's reputation.
     2. If users cannot easily withdraw consent, the GDPR would view this as an infringement on individuals' rights, reducing trust in the service and potentially leading to legal repercussions.
     3. If granular consent was mandatory, the current policy may need modification to explicitly mention each purpose of the cookies used (analysis, performance, marketing, individual marketing) and allow users to choose only those they are comfortable with.
     4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, it would violate GDPR's requirement for transparency. Users have a right to know which third parties their data will be shared with, and this information must be clearly presented in the cookie policy.
     5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield), it would breach GDPR's data protection principles, as transfers outside the EU must comply with strict conditions to ensure adequate protection of personal data.
   - Final Justification: The cookie policy requires improvements in terms of providing clear explanations for each type of cookie, explicitly mentioning third-party providers, and detailing data transfer processes (if applicable). Ensuring compliance with these aspects will help maintain user trust and prevent potential legal repercussions under the GDPR.

   Main Compliance Analysis:
   - The policy provides clear information about the purposes for which cookies are used, and offers users the choice to consent or decline (Article 13 & 12 GDPR). However, it does not explicitly state that cookies will be stored for a specific period. Also, the granularity of consent options seems adequate but could still be improved to ensure maximum transparency (Article 5 & 7 GDPR).
   - The policy provides users with the possibility to revoke their consent easily, although it may not be immediately clear where and how this can be done in certain cases.
   - Users are informed about data sharing with third parties, but information about the specific partners and their roles as joint controllers should ideally also be included (Article 26 GDPR).

   Counterfactual Impact:
   1. If explicit consent was not obtained, this would directly contradict the principle of transparency and accountability, making the policy non-compliant with GDPR.
   2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, this could potentially constitute a breach of their right to withdraw consent at any time, impacting compliance negatively.
   3. Mandating granular consent would not significantly change the current situation, as the policy already offers a high level of granularity in terms of choosing which cookies users want to allow or decline.
   4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, this could violate the principle of transparency, making the policy non-compliant with GDPR.
   5. Data transfer to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards would likely be a breach of Article 44 & 46 GDPR, leading to non-compliance.

   Final Justification: The policy offers users the choice to consent or decline cookies and provides information about their purposes, although it could be improved in terms of providing explicit consent, specifying third-party roles, and clarifying data storage periods.

   Suggestions for Improvement:

      - If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, it would violate Article 14 of GDPR, which requires informing users about recipients or categories of recipients of their personal data.
      - If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without appropriate safeguards, it would be a breach of the GDPR's Chapter V, which regulates international transfers of personal data.

   - Final Justification: The policy provides some information about cookies and user rights but is incomplete in terms of ensuring compliance with GDPR due to the lack of explicit consent documentation, easy withdrawal methods for users, granular consent, and transparency regarding third-party data sharing and international data transfers.

   - Suggestions for Improvement:
      - Clearly document when and how the user's initial consent was obtained.

   - Counterfactual Impact:
    1. If explicit consent was not obtained for non-essential cookies, it would make the policy Non-Compliant with GDPR since users should agree before any non-essential cookies are set.
    2. If users cannot easily withdraw consent, it would create an impact as users might feel they have limited control over their personal data and could potentially lead to a breach of trust and privacy concerns.
    3. If granular consent were mandatory, the policy would need to be updated to allow users to choose specific categories of cookies they agree to instead of accepting all or rejecting all at once.

   - Main Compliance Analysis: The policy provides information about the use of cookies, offers options to accept or reject them, and refers users to a privacy page. However, it does not meet all GDPR requirements as it lacks explicit consent for non-essential cookies, does not specify how users can withdraw consent easily, and does not provide granular control over specific types of cookies beyond ""Accept All"" and ""Reject All.""
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the policy would be non-compliant as GDPR requires explicit and informed consent for non-essential cookies. This could lead to potential fines or legal action.
     2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, the policy would still be partially compliant but it would be in breach of GDPR's requirement that users have control over their personal data. Users may feel frustrated and less trusting of the website.
     3. If granular consent was mandatory, the current policy would not comply since it does not offer users the option to individually accept or reject different types of cookies. This is a fundamental aspect of GDPR compliance for cookie policies.
     4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, the policy would be non-compliant as GDPR requires that users are informed about and have control over the sharing of their personal data.
     5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards, the policy would still be partially compliant but it would be in breach of GDPR regulations that require adequate protection for personal data transferred outside the EU.
   - Final Justification: The current policy does not fully comply with GDPR due to its lack of explicit consent, granular control over cookies, and transparency regarding data sharing and transfer.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To achieve full compliance, Fresenius Medical Care should make it possible for users to provide explicit and informed consent for each type of non-essential cookie used on their site. They should also offer clear information about data sharing with third parties and the use of safeguards for data transfers outside the EU. Additionally, they should simplify the process for users to withdraw consent easily and at any time."

   - Main Compliance Analysis: The policy provides clear information about the types of cookies used (strictly necessary, performance, marketing), their purpose, and the legal basis for their use. However, it does not provide a mechanism for users to withdraw consent easily, nor is there complete transparency about data sharing with third parties or safeguards for data transfer to non-EU countries.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. If explicit consent was not obtained, this would be a significant violation of GDPR as it requires clear and affirmative action from the user for each category of cookie. This could lead to enforcement actions, fines, and damage to reputation.
     2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, this would be non-compliant with GDPR which emphasizes the right to withdraw consent at any time. This could result in user frustration, potential legal action, and negative publicity.
     3. If granular consent was mandatory, the current policy would need to be updated to allow users to choose specific categories of cookies they accept. This would require a more complex consent management system but would ensure compliance with GDPR requirements for user choice and control.
     4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, this would be a breach of GDPR's transparency principle. This could lead to user mistrust, potential legal action, and damage to the company's reputation.
     5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards, this would be a significant violation of GDPR as it requires appropriate safeguards for such transfers. This could result in enforcement actions, fines, and damage to reputation.

However, it does not explicitly require consent for necessary cookies (which are essential for website functionality) as per GDPR requirements. Also, the level of granularity provided in the consent options may not meet the standards for granular consent as per GDPR.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
      1. If explicit consent was not obtained, it would lead to non-compliance with GDPR, potentially resulting in penalties and loss of user trust.
      2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, it would violate the principle of transparency and user control over their data, impacting user trust and potential legal consequences.
      3. Mandatory granular consent would require a more detailed breakdown of each cookie category and explicit consent for each, which is currently not provided in this policy. This would improve compliance.
      4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, it would violate the principles of transparency and informed consent under GDPR, leading to loss of user trust and potential legal consequences.

   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. Non-obtaining of explicit consent would render the policy non-compliant, as GDPR requires explicit and informed consent for the use of cookies. This could lead to potential fines and damage to user trust.
     2. If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, it would be in violation of GDPR, which emphasizes the right to withdraw consent at any time. This could result in user dissatisfaction, loss of trust, and potential legal consequences.
     3. Mandatory granular consent would make the policy more compliant, as users would have a clear understanding of what specific cookies are being used and for what purposes. However, this might also lead to a less pleasant user experience due to the increased number of choices presented.
     4. If data sharing with third parties is not transparent, it would breach GDPR's requirement for transparency. This could result in users feeling misled or deceived, damaging trust and potentially leading to legal consequences.
     5. Data transfer to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses, Privacy Shield) would render the policy non-compliant. This could lead to potential fines, damage to user trust, and legal challenges.

   Main Compliance Analysis: The cookie policy provides information about the types of cookies used, the purpose of their use (necessary, performance, marketing), and options for users to customize or deny consent. However, it does not explicitly state that cookies are used for storing personal data such as IP addresses or browser information, which is a GDPR requirement. Also, while there's an option to revoke consent, the ease of withdrawal could be improved as the process is buried within the 'Customize' section rather than being readily accessible.

   Counterfactual Impact:
   1. Non-compliance if explicit consent was not obtained: Users would be subjected to potentially unwanted data processing without their knowledge or consent, which could lead to penalties under GDPR.
   2. Difficulty in withdrawing consent easily: If users find it hard to revoke their consent, they may feel a lack of control over their personal data, leading to potential complaints and damage to the organization's reputation.
   3. Mandatory granular consent: Requiring granular consent would force users to explicitly agree to each category (necessary, performance, marketing) before using the website, which could lead to a lower conversion rate due to increased friction in the user experience.
   4. Opaque data sharing with third parties: If data sharing with third parties is not transparent, users may be unknowingly sharing their personal data, which is non-compliant under GDPR. This could result in legal penalties and loss of trust from users.
   5. Data transfer to non-EU countries without safeguards: Transferring personal data to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the Privacy Shield) would be a breach of GDPR, leading to potential legal action and reputational damage.

   Final Justification: The cookie policy provides some information about cookies used on the website but falls short in certain areas, such as explicitly stating that personal data is collected, making it easy for users to revoke their consent, and ensuring transparent data sharing with third parties. These issues need to be addressed to ensure full compliance with GDPR.

   Suggestions for Improvement:
   1. Explicitly state that cookies collect personal data such as IP addresses or browser information.
   2. Make it easier for users to withdraw their consent by placing the option in a more prominent location and using clear, concise language.
   3. Ensure transparency regarding data sharing with third parties and implement appropriate safeguards for international data transfers.
   4. Review the process of obtaining granular consent to ensure it does not unduly burden users or decrease conversion rates.

   Main Compliance Analysis:
   - The policy provides a clear notice about the use of cookies and similar technologies, and users can either agree or deny the processing.
   - Users are allowed to modify settings or withdraw consent at any time.
   - However, the policy does not provide a clear explanation on how data is shared with third parties, which is a requirement under GDPR. Also, the variety of third-party tools listed may be confusing for some users.
   - The list of categories does not offer granular control over each type of cookie or tracking technology, which could potentially violate the principle of transparency and user control under GDPR.

   Counterfactual Impact:
   1. Non-Compliance: If explicit consent was not obtained, it would be a violation of GDPR, as users must actively give their consent for data processing. This could lead to penalties and damage to the company's reputation.
   2. Impact: If users cannot easily withdraw consent, this would violate the right of users to access their information and control how it is used. This could result in user dissatisfaction, potential legal action, and negative publicity.
   3. Non-Compliance: If granular consent was mandatory, the current policy does not provide this level of detail. This would be a violation of GDPR, which requires clear and specific disclosure and consent for each type of processing activity.
   4. Non-Compliance: If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, this would violate the principles of transparency and fairness under GDPR. This could lead to penalties, damage to the company's reputation, and potential loss of user trust.
   5. Non-Compliance: If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without appropriate safeguards, this would be a violation of GDPR. This could result in penalties, legal action, and damage to the company's reputation.

   Final Justification: The policy provides some necessary elements for GDPR compliance but falls short in key areas such as transparency and user control. Improvements are needed to fully comply with GDPR requirements.

   Suggestions for Improvement:
   1. Clearly explain how data is shared with third parties, providing transparency about each third party and the purpose of data sharing.
   2. Offer granular control over different types of cookies and tracking technologies to give users more control over their information.
   3. Ensure that users can easily withdraw consent without having to navigate a complex settings menu or contact customer support.

It also does not specify how users can withdraw their consent easily.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. Non-obtaining of explicit consent for non-essential cookies would make the policy non-compliant with GDPR as it requires obtaining explicit and informed consent for any non-essential cookies. This could lead to potential fines and damage to the company's reputation.
     2. If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, this would not be compliant with GDPR as it requires that users have the ability to withdraw their consent at any time. This could potentially impact user trust and engagement.
     3. Making granular consent mandatory would make the policy more compliant with GDPR as it allows users to choose which categories of cookies they accept. However, it may negatively affect user experience if too many cookie options are presented.
     4. Not being transparent about data sharing with third parties would violate GDPR principles, potentially leading to fines and damage to the company's reputation.
     5. Transferring data to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards would not comply with GDPR data protection rules, which require adequate protection for transfers outside of the EU. This could lead to legal challenges and potential fines.
   - Final Justification: The policy provides a basic foundation for understanding cookies, but it does not meet all requirements of the GDPR regarding explicit consent, retention period, purpose specification, easy withdrawal of consent, and data transfer safeguards.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To comply with GDPR fully, the policy should be revised to include specific details about the retention period for cookies, purpose specification, and mechanisms for obtaining explicit consent for non-essential cookies.

It also allows users to adjust their cookie settings at any time according to their wishes. However, it does not clearly state that the user's consent is a legal requirement, nor does it offer granular control over which specific types of cookies are accepted.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. Non-compliance due to lack of explicit consent: The website would be non-compliant as the user's consent is not explicitly obtained before setting cookies. This could lead to potential fines under GDPR.

Main Compliance Analysis:
- The policy provides a clear explanation of the purposes for using cookies and offers users three options to manage their consent. This includes the option to accept only necessary cookies, customize preferences, or accept all processing purposes.
- The policy does not specify how long the data is stored and the purpose of storing this data which could potentially be a GDPR violation.
- The list of data processing providers (IAB TCF Providers and Non-IAB TCF Providers) is provided but the policy lacks transparency regarding the specific purposes for which each provider processes personal data, as required by GDPR.

Counterfactual Impact:
1. If explicit consent was not obtained: This would result in non-compliance with GDPR as it mandates obtaining clear and affirmative consent from users before storing or accessing their personal data through cookies.
2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily: This would impede user control over their data, potentially infringing on the right to privacy and thus violating GDPR.
3. If granular consent was mandatory: The policy currently offers a degree of granularity with the ""More Options"" feature but does not provide explicit options for each processing purpose. A more granular approach would better align with GDPR requirements.
4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent: Lack of transparency about the specific purposes for which data is shared with third parties could lead to non-compliance with GDPR, as it mandates providing clear and concise information about how personal data will be processed.
5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards: Without proper safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield), data transfers to non-EU countries could be deemed a violation of GDPR, as it restricts the transfer of personal data outside the EU unless certain conditions are met.

Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR by offering users options to manage their consent and providing some information about data processing providers. However, it lacks transparency regarding data storage times and specific purposes for which each provider processes personal data, as well as the potential absence of explicit consent.

Suggestions for Improvement:
- Clearly specify the purpose and duration of data storage in the cookie policy.
- Provide more granular options for users to manage their consent, including individual processing purposes and providers.
- Offer transparent and detailed information about the specific purposes for which each data processing provider processes personal data.
- Ensure that explicit consent is obtained from users before storing or accessing their personal data through cookies.

However, it lacks explicit consent in the initial banner and easy withdrawal of consent mechanisms. The granularity of consent is not enforced, but there's an option to decline all or accept individual categories.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
      1. Non-Compliance: Lack of explicit consent could lead to potential fines under GDPR as users are passively opted in rather than actively agreeing.
      2. Non-Compliance: If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, it may be difficult for them to exercise their rights, which is a violation of GDPR principles.
      3. Compliance Change: Enforcing granular consent would require separate, explicit opt-ins for each category of data processing. This could lead to improved transparency and control but might complicate the user experience.
      4. Non-Compliance: Data sharing with third parties should be transparent at the point of collection and users should be given clear options to accept or reject this data sharing.
      5. Non-Compliance: Transferring data to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) could result in fines and reputational damage.

However, it does not explicitly state that the user has given consent, and data sharing with third parties is only partially transparent as not all partners are listed.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     - If explicit consent was not obtained, it would make the policy non-compliant, as per GDPR Article 6(1)(a), which requires explicit consent for processing personal data.
     - If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, it would impact compliance negatively because GDPR gives users the right to withdraw their consent at any time.
     - Mandatory granular consent might make the policy more compliant, depending on how each category of cookie is essential or non-essential. However, it could potentially create a less user-friendly experience if too many choices are presented to the user.
     - If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, it would lead to non-compliance, as per Article 14 of GDPR, which requires transparency about who receives the data.
     - Data transfer to non-EU countries without safeguards would be a violation of GDPR Article 46, which requires appropriate safeguards when transferring personal data outside the EU/EEA.
   - Final Justification: The policy provides some level of transparency and control for users but falls short in several areas that are critical to GDPR compliance, such as explicit consent and full disclosure of third-party data processors.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To comply with GDPR fully, the cookie policy should include explicit language stating that the user has given consent, provide a more comprehensive list of third-party data processors (including those used for marketing), ensure data transfers to non-EU countries are made through appropriate safeguards, and make it easy for users to withdraw their consent at any time."

     - However, it lacks clarity on how long the data will be stored, which is required under GDPR Article 5(e).
     - Additionally, explicit consent for all third-party cookies (e.g., Facebook Pixel, Google Ads Conversion) is not obtained at the time of first visit, as only an option to ""Accept All"" is provided initially. This could be non-compliant if users do not actively select individual options within the Change Settings section.
     - The policy does not mention the transfer of data to non-EU countries (e.g., USA for Facebook and YouTube), which is a potential GDPR compliance issue unless appropriate safeguards are in place.

   - Counterfactual Impact:
     - If explicit consent was not obtained, it would render the policy non-compliant. Users may not be aware of or have control over their data processing activities.
     - If users cannot easily withdraw consent, they might feel frustrated and lose trust in the website. This could potentially impact the website's reputation and user engagement.
     - Making granular consent mandatory would mean a more complex process for users, which could lead to increased frustration and potential loss of users if it slows down the user experience.
     - If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, users might be uncomfortable with their data being shared without knowing who or where it is going. This lack of transparency could negatively impact user trust and potentially lead to legal issues.
     - Data transfer to non-EU countries without safeguards would violate GDPR requirements, leading to potential fines and reputational damage.

However, it lacks explicitness in certain areas such as the purpose for marketing cookies (interests-based advertising) and the specific third parties with whom data may be shared.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the policy would be non-compliant under GDPR as obtaining informed and specific consent is mandatory for storing or accessing information on a user's device.
     2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, the policy would be partially compliant as it does offer a way to revoke consent through the Privacy Information section, but ease of withdrawal plays a crucial role in GDPR compliance.
     3. If granular consent was mandatory (meaning each cookie category must be consented to individually), the policy would require modification to meet this standard as users currently can only choose between all categories or necessary cookies only.
     4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, the policy would become non-compliant under GDPR as users have a right to know which specific third parties their data may be shared with.
     5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards, the policy would be non-compliant as transferring personal data outside of the EU requires appropriate safeguards to ensure data protection.

      - The policy also mentions data sharing with third parties but does not clearly describe the purpose of data processing or the type of data being shared. This may raise concerns about transparency.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
      - If explicit consent was not obtained, it would render the policy non-compliant as per GDPR requirements for valid consent.
      - If users cannot withdraw consent easily, it would compromise their control over their personal data and potentially breach GDPR principles regarding user autonomy.
      - Mandatory granular consent would require users to explicitly agree to each category of cookies, which the current policy does not provide. This would necessitate revisions to accommodate granular consent options.
      - If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, it could violate GDPR principles of transparency and fair processing, as users would not be aware of how their data is being used by these parties.

Main Compliance Analysis:
- The cookie policy informs users about the types of cookies used (essential, marketing, statistical) and provides options for adjusting consent. However, there is no explicit mention that cookies are stored on a user's device or their lifespan.
- The policy clearly explains how to adjust consent settings and allows for future changes.
- The descriptions of categories & services include both first and third-party cookies, but they do not provide sufficient information about the specific purposes for which the data will be used.

Counterfactual Impact:
1. If explicit consent was not obtained: Non-compliance with GDPR as it requires clear, affirmative action from users to give their consent. Actions without consent would be non-compliant and could lead to penalties.
2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily: Although the policy allows for future changes, if the process is too complex or not readily accessible, it could still be considered non-compliant under GDPR's principle of giving individuals control over their data.
3. If granular consent was mandatory: In this case, the current policy might still fall short as users are presented with two options (allow all cookies or essential cookies only) without a clear understanding of what each category entails. This could be improved by providing more detailed information and allowing users to select individual services or types of cookies they want to consent to.
4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent: Non-compliance as GDPR requires transparency regarding the use of third-party cookies and the purposes for which user data will be used. In this case, while some third parties are listed, more information about their specific purposes could be provided.
5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards: Non-compliance with GDPR as it prohibits transferring personal data outside the EU without appropriate safeguards or mechanisms. Since there's no mention of data transfers, it is unclear if appropriate measures are in place for this scenario.

Final Justification: The cookie policy provides some essential information but lacks detail on certain aspects, such as lifespan and purpose of cookies, third-party usage specificities, and data transfer safeguards. These deficiencies make the policy partially compliant with GDPR requirements.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Clearly explain the purposes for each category of cookies (essential, marketing, statistical) and how long they will be stored on a user's device.
2. Provide more detailed descriptions of third-party services included in the policy.
3. Offer granular consent options to allow users to choose specific services or types of cookies they want to consent to.
4. Ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place for data transfers outside the EU, if applicable.
5. Periodically review and update the cookie policy to maintain compliance with GDPR guidelines."

   Main Compliance Analysis:
   - The policy provides a mechanism for users to manage their cookie preferences, meeting the transparency requirement.
   - Users can customize their cookie settings and are informed about the purpose of each category, which is essential for consent.
   - However, the policy does not clearly state that consent is required for non-essential cookies or provide a way to easily withdraw consent, potentially causing non-compliance issues.

   Counterfactual Impact:
   - If explicit consent was not obtained, it would lead to potential non-compliance with GDPR, as user activity could be tracked without clear indication and agreement.
   - If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, they may feel a lack of control over their data, potentially affecting trust in the website or service.
   - Granular consent is mandatory under GDPR to provide transparency and control, so requiring granular consent would make the current policy fully compliant.
   - Not being transparent about data sharing with third parties could lead to non-compliance since users should be informed about any data processing partners.
   - Data transfer to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses, Binding Corporate Rules, or specific certifications) would not comply with GDPR regulations.

   Final Justification: The policy provides some transparency and options for users to manage their preferences, but it lacks explicit statements regarding the requirement of consent for non-essential cookies and an easy way to withdraw that consent. This leads to partial compliance with GDPR.

   Suggestions for Improvement:
   - Explicitly state that user consent is required for non-essential cookies.
   - Provide a simple and accessible method for users to withdraw their consent easily, either within the cookie settings or directly on the website.
   - Include a clear explanation of data sharing with third parties in the Cookie Policy, and consider obtaining explicit consent for these partnerships if required by the specific circumstances.
   - Implement safeguards for any data transfers to non-EU countries as needed under GDPR regulations."

Main Compliance Analysis:
1. Explicit Consent: The policy provides multiple options for users to accept or reject cookies, including the option to manage cookie settings. However, it does not specify when and how explicit consent was obtained upon the first visit of the website.
2. Withdrawal of Consent: Users are allowed to revoke their consent at any time via the Cookie Policy, which meets this requirement.
3. Granular Consent: The policy offers granular control over non-essential cookies by allowing users to manage and customize preferences. This could be considered as an indicator of compliance with the need for granular consent if implemented consistently across all cookies.
4. Transparency in Data Sharing: The policy informs users about data transfer to the USA when they opt-in to non-essential cookies, which is transparent but falls short of GDPR requirements since it does not clearly specify third parties involved in data sharing.
5. Transfer of Data to Non-EU Countries: The policy informs users that data may be processed in the USA and mentions the potential risks associated with this transfer. However, it does not ensure compliance if adequate safeguards are not in place to protect user data.

Counterfactual Impact:
1. If explicit consent was not obtained upon the first visit, it would render the policy non-compliant since GDPR requires explicit and informed consent for the use of cookies.
2. If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, they may feel that their privacy is being compromised, which could negatively impact trust in the website and potentially lead to legal consequences.
3. Making granular consent mandatory could provide users with more control over their data, improving transparency and trust. However, it might also increase complexity in implementing and managing cookie settings.
4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, users may be unaware of how their data is being used, which goes against the principle of transparency in GDPR. This could lead to user dissatisfaction and potential legal implications.
5. Transferring data to non-EU countries without adequate safeguards would put user data at risk, potentially leading to legal consequences and damage to the reputation of the website or organization.

Final Justification: While the policy allows users to manage their cookie preferences and informs them about potential risks associated with US data processing, it falls short in some areas such as transparency in data sharing and ensuring compliance when transferring data to non-EU countries.

Suggestions for Improvement: To ensure full GDPR compliance, the policy should clearly specify third parties involved in data sharing, provide more detailed information about adequate safeguards when transferring data to non-EU countries, and consider obtaining explicit consent upon the first visit of the website."

Main Compliance Analysis: The policy provides options for users to accept or reject cookies, and it describes the purposes of each type of cookie. However, it lacks transparency regarding third-party data sharing and does not explicitly state that users can easily withdraw their consent.

Counterfactual Impact:
1. If explicit consent was not obtained, this would be a clear violation of GDPR as user consent is essential for the use of cookies. The consequences could include significant fines and damage to reputation.
2. If users cannot easily withdraw consent, this would negatively impact compliance with GDPR, as individuals must have the right to withdraw their consent at any time. This could lead to regulatory scrutiny and potential penalties.
3. If granular consent was mandatory, the current policy would not meet these requirements as it does not provide users with a granular level of control over the specific cookies they accept or reject. This would necessitate an update to the policy to give users more control over their data.
4. Data sharing with third parties is only mentioned in passing without providing transparency about which specific third parties the data is shared with, what data is being shared, and for what purposes. This lack of clarity could lead to non-compliance with GDPR.
5. The policy does not specify whether or how data transfer to non-EU countries occurs, and if safeguards are in place to ensure compliance with GDPR regulations on such transfers. This omission could result in potential breaches of the GDPR rules regarding international data transfers.

Final Justification: The cookie policy partially complies with GDPR as it provides options for users to accept or reject cookies, and it describes the purposes of each type of cookie. However, it lacks clarity about third-party data sharing, fails to explicitly state that users can easily withdraw their consent, and does not disclose whether or how data transfer to non-EU countries occurs.

Suggestions for Improvement: To improve compliance with GDPR, the following action points should be considered:
1. Clearly state that explicit consent is required for the use of cookies and obtain such consent from users.
2. Provide transparency about third-party data sharing, including which specific third parties the data is shared with, what data is being shared, and for what purposes.
3. Make it easy for users to withdraw their consent at any time.
4. If granular consent is not currently feasible, consider implementing this feature in the future to give users more control over their data.
5. Specify whether or how data transfer to non-EU countries occurs and ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to comply with GDPR regulations on such transfers."

   - Main Compliance Analysis: The cookie policy provides information about the use of cookies, user choices, and data transfer outside the EU. However, it lacks transparency regarding minor partners who also use these technologies, which is required under GDPR. Additionally, while users are given options to accept or reject certain categories of cookies, explicit consent for analytics and marketing cookies is only granted when the ""Accept All"" option is chosen, which may not always be in line with user preferences.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. If explicit consent was not obtained (for example, if ""Accept All"" was the default option), this would be a non-compliance issue as users should have control over their data and explicitly consent to its processing.
     2. If users cannot easily withdraw consent, it could lead to potential privacy concerns and non-compliance with GDPR as users must have the ability to modify or revoke their consent at any time.
     3. Mandatory granular consent would require a more nuanced approach where users can give explicit consent for each type of cookie category. This is recommended but not required under GDPR, so it could still be considered partially compliant as long as users have some control over their data.
     4. Data sharing with third parties (minor partners) should also be transparent to users, and this is currently a gap in the policy. Sharing user data without explicit consent or necessary safeguards would not comply with GDPR.
     5. The disclosure about data transfer to non-EU countries without adequate safeguards does comply with GDPR requirements. However, if these transfers occur without appropriate measures in place, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the EU-US Privacy Shield, the compliance would be compromised.
   - Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR by providing information, choices, and disclosing data transfer. However, it falls short on transparency regarding third parties (minor partners) and obtaining explicit consent for certain cookie categories.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: Make explicit consent mandatory for all cookies, provide a clear explanation of the purpose and recipients for each category of cookies, include minor partners in the partner list, and ensure users can easily withdraw their consent at any time."
counterfactual_scenario,partially-compliant,partially_compliant_14.docx,mistral:latest," Classification: Partially Compliant

Main Compliance Analysis:
- The policy provides users with clear options to accept or reject cookies, and a link to the Privacy Policy.
- It separates necessary and non-necessary cookies, which is essential for GDPR compliance.
- However, the policy does not meet all GDPR requirements because it lacks an explicit statement about data processing activities related to cookies (purpose limitation), transparency regarding data sharing with third parties, and information about international data transfer safeguards.

Counterfactual Impact:
1. If explicit consent was not obtained, it would make the policy Non-Compliant with GDPR as obtaining consent is a fundamental requirement. Users should have control over their personal data and must explicitly agree to its processing.
2. If users cannot easily withdraw consent, this may be considered as non-transparent and inflexible, which could lead to Non-Compliance with GDPR as users' rights to access, modify, or delete their data must be respected.
3. Making granular consent mandatory would require a more detailed explanation of each type of cookie, its purpose, and the partners involved. As the current policy is not specific enough for this level of detail, it may initially become Non-Compliant but could be brought into compliance with additional information.
4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, it would be a violation of the principle of transparency and therefore, Non-Compliance with GDPR as users must be informed about who will process their personal data and for what purposes.
5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards, it could lead to Non-Compliance as data protection rules outside the EU may not offer equivalent protection. The policy should ensure appropriate safeguards are in place (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) before transferring personal data to third countries or international organizations.

Final Justification:
While the policy provides options for users to control their data, it does not fully comply with GDPR due to a lack of information about data processing activities, transparency regarding data sharing with third parties, and international data transfer safeguards. To ensure compliance, Vodafone should update its Cookie Policy to provide clearer explanations of data processing activities, partners involved, and data transfer safeguards.

Suggestions for Improvement:
- Add specific details about the purpose of each type of cookie, including data processing activities related to cookies, in the Cookie Policy.
- Include transparency regarding data sharing with third parties, especially marketing and social network partners.
- Specify safeguards for international data transfer, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield certification.
- Offer users an easily accessible and simple way to withdraw their consent at any time.
- Provide additional information about how users can access, modify, or delete their data, in accordance with GDPR user rights."

   - Main Compliance Analysis: The policy provides clear information about the use of cookies, the ability to manage preferences, and a mechanism for withdrawing consent. However, it does not meet all GDPR requirements as it does not clearly specify the retention period of cookies, nor is it explicitly stated that only essential cookies are active by default (as per the GDPR recommendation).
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. Non-compliance if explicit consent was not obtained: The policy states users can withdraw consent at any time; however, it does not specify whether cookies are set before obtaining explicit consent. This could lead to non-compliance with GDPR as users might experience cookies being active before they have given their consent.
     2. Users cannot easily withdraw consent: Although the policy allows users to manage and withdraw consent, the ease of this process is subjective. It would impact compliance negatively if the process were too complex or not easily accessible.
     3. Granular consent was mandatory: In this hypothetical scenario, the website should provide more detailed options for users to choose which specific cookies they allow. The current policy does not meet this requirement as it groups performance, functional, and targeting cookies together without allowing individual selection.
     4. Data sharing with third parties was not transparent: Although the policy mentions the use of cookies for personalized advertising (targeting cookies), it does not explicitly state whether these cookies are shared with third-party advertisers. This would negatively impact compliance as GDPR requires transparency regarding data sharing.
     5. Data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards: If the website were to transfer cookie data to non-EU countries, it would need to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses, Binding Corporate Rules). The policy does not address this, which could lead to non-compliance with GDPR.
   - Final Justification: Although the policy provides users with the ability to manage and withdraw their consent, it fails to meet several key GDPR requirements such as explicit initial consent, transparency regarding data sharing, and specifying retention periods for cookies.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: Update the policy to ensure compliance by providing more detailed options for managing cookie preferences, explicitly stating that only essential cookies are active by default, clearly explaining data retention periods, and addressing any potential data transfer to non-EU countries with appropriate safeguards. Additionally, consider consulting a legal expert to ensure the policy meets all GDPR requirements."

   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the policy would be non-compliant since obtaining informed and unambiguous consent is crucial under GDPR. This could result in fines or legal actions.

     2. Withdrawing consent: Users can adjust their settings at any time, which is a positive aspect. However, the ease of finding and modifying these settings could be improved for better user experience.
     3. Granular consent: The policy offers granular options to accept or decline specific categories of cookies. While this falls in line with GDPR's requirements for granular consent, the explanations provided for each category might need improvement for increased transparency.
     4. Transparent data sharing with third parties: The policy lists 96 third-party providers and their purposes. This level of transparency is satisfactory under GDPR.
     5. Data transfer to non-EU countries: The policy does not mention whether any safeguards are in place for data transferred to non-EU countries, which could potentially lead to non-compliance with GDPR.

- Third-party cookie use is transparent but providing a link to each third party's privacy policy would further enhance compliance.

Counterfactual Impact:
1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the policy would be non-compliant as it violates the fundamental GDPR principle of informed consent. Users have a right to decide on their personal data processing and sharing.
2. If users cannot easily withdraw consent, the policy would still be partially compliant, but its effectiveness in maintaining user trust and adherence to regulations would be compromised.

   - Main Compliance Analysis: The policy provides clear information about the types of cookies used, their purposes, and how they can be managed by users. However, it does not explicitly state that consent for non-necessary cookies is required under GDPR, nor does it provide a simple and straightforward method for users to withdraw their consent easily.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
    1. If explicit consent was not obtained, this would make the policy non-compliant as per the GDPR's requirement for explicit and unambiguous consent. The impact would be potential fines and damage to the organization's reputation due to lack of trust from users.
    2. If users cannot withdraw their consent easily, this would negatively affect user experience and may lead to non-compliance as users might feel they have no control over their data. This could also impact the organization's relationship with its customers due to potential loss of trust.
    3. If granular consent was mandatory, the current policy would need to be updated to provide a more detailed list of specific cookies and their functions, along with clear opt-in/opt-out options for each. This would ensure users have full control over their data and improve transparency.
    4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, this would make the policy non-compliant as per GDPR's requirement for transparency regarding data sharing practices. The impact would be potential fines, damage to the organization's reputation due to lack of trust from users, and possible legal action by affected individuals.
    5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without appropriate safeguards, this would make the policy non-compliant as per GDPR's requirement for adequate protection of personal data transferred outside the EU. The impact would be potential fines, damage to the organization's reputation due to lack of trust from users, and possible legal action by affected individuals.
   - Final Justification: Although the policy provides some information about cookies and how they can be managed, it does not meet all GDPR requirements for explicit consent, easy withdrawal of consent, granularity in consent options, transparency in data sharing practices, and adequate protection of personal data transferred outside the EU.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To ensure full compliance with GDPR, the policy should be updated to provide explicit consent options for all cookies, offer a simple and straightforward method for users to withdraw their consent, offer granular consent options, clearly state data sharing practices with third parties, and ensure adequate protection of personal data transferred outside the EU through appropriate safeguards."

   - Main Compliance Analysis: The cookie policy provides information about the types of cookies used, their purpose, and their lifespan, which is essential for transparency. However, it does not explicitly state whether or not consent was obtained, does not provide a simple way for users to withdraw consent, and lacks clarity on data sharing with third parties.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. If explicit consent was not obtained, this would render the policy non-compliant as GDPR requires explicit consent for the use of cookies.
     2. If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, this would violate the right to withdraw consent at any time, which is a key requirement under GDPR.
     3. If granular consent was mandatory (meaning users must consent to each type of cookie individually), this could potentially complicate the user experience but would still be compliant as long as it allows for easy revocation.
     4. Lack of transparency about data sharing with third parties would make the policy non-compliant, as GDPR requires clear information about such sharing.
     5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards, this would be a breach of GDPR regulations, which require appropriate safeguards for such transfers.
   - Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR because it provides essential information but falls short in areas like obtaining and allowing easy withdrawal of consent, transparency about third-party data sharing, and ensuring appropriate safeguards for international data transfer.
   - Suggestions for Improvement:
     1. Clearly state whether or not explicit consent was obtained at the outset of the policy.

However, it lacks transparency regarding data sharing with third parties, data transfer to non-EU countries, and specific instructions for users to easily withdraw consent.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the cookie policy would be Non-Compliant with GDPR as it requires clear and affirmative action from the user. The lack of explicit consent may lead to potential legal issues and penalties.
     2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, this would affect compliance as users should have the right to manage their preferences at any time. This inability could potentially violate the principle of data minimization and control under GDPR.
     3. If granular consent was mandatory, the cookie policy would need to be updated to allow users to give or revoke consent for each category of cookies individually. Compliance would improve as it would meet the user's expectation of control over their data.
     4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, this would make the policy Non-Compliant with GDPR as users should be informed about such practices and have the right to object if necessary. Lack of transparency could lead to potential data breaches and privacy violations.
     5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards, this would be Non-Compliant with GDPR. Data protection regulations require adequate safeguards for personal data transferred outside the EU, such as standard contractual clauses or Privacy Shield certification.
   - Final Justification: The cookie policy is partially compliant because it provides information about the use and categories of cookies but lacks transparency regarding third-party data sharing and data transfer to non-EU countries, as well as easy methods for users to withdraw consent.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To improve compliance, the following action points are suggested:
     1. Clearly indicate data sharing with third parties in the cookie policy and provide information about the safeguards used (e.g., standard contractual clauses).
     2. Update the policy to allow users to give or revoke consent for each category of cookies individually if granular consent is mandatory under GDPR.

However, it lacks explicit consent for non-essential cookies, easy withdrawal methods, granular consent options, transparency regarding third-party data sharing, and appropriate safeguards for data transfer to non-EU countries.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. Non-explicit consent: This would render the policy non-compliant as explicit and informed consent is required under GDPR for non-essential cookies.
     2. Difficulty in withdrawing consent: If users find it difficult to withdraw their consent, this could potentially lead to a breach of the right to withdraw consent, making the policy non-compliant.
     3. Granular consent: Mandatory granular consent would require users to explicitly approve each category of cookies they agree to. The current policy does not meet this requirement.
     4. Lack of transparency regarding third-party data sharing: If data sharing with third parties is not transparent, it could lead to a breach of the principle of transparency, making the policy non-compliant.
     5. Data transfer to non-EU countries without safeguards: Transferring data to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield) would violate GDPR, rendering the policy non-compliant.
   - Final Justification: The policy does not fully comply with GDPR due to its lack of explicit consent for non-essential cookies, inadequate methods for withdrawing consent, insufficient granularity, unclear information regarding third-party data sharing, and potentially illegal data transfers to non-EU countries.
   - Suggestions for Improvement:
     1. Obtain explicit and informed consent for all categories of cookies (essential and non-essential) before storing or accessing personal data.

   - Main Compliance Analysis: The cookie policy provides a clear explanation of the use of cookies, the purpose of each category, and an option for users to give or withdraw consent. However, it does not explicitly state when the user first visits the website, which is a requirement under GDPR. Additionally, the 'Accept All' button grants consent for data processing in third countries, but there is no separate option for users to confirm this, potentially violating the principle of granularity.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. If explicit consent was not obtained, it would render the policy non-compliant as GDPR requires clear and affirmative action from the user.
     2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, it could lead to a violation of their rights under GDPR.
     3. Mandatory granular consent would necessitate a more individualized approach, allowing users to select specific categories of data processing they agree to. This is currently not the case with the 'Accept All' button.
     4. Lack of transparency in data sharing with third parties could result in non-compliance as users should be informed about these practices.
     5. Data transfer to non-EU countries without adequate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the EU-US Privacy Shield) would compromise compliance.
   - Final Justification: The policy provides some essential elements of GDPR compliance, such as informing users about cookies and allowing them to give or withdraw consent. However, it falls short in areas like obtaining explicit consent, ensuring granularity, and being transparent about data sharing with third parties and data transfers outside the EU.

      The policy provides information about the use of cookies, offers settings for managing cookie preferences, and mentions the possibility of withdrawing consent. However, it does not explicitly state that consent is required for non-essential cookies, which is a crucial aspect of GDPR compliance. Also, the policy lacks transparency on data sharing with third parties and the measures taken for international data transfer.

   - Counterfactual Impact:
      - If explicit consent was not obtained, it would be non-compliant as per GDPR requirements. This could lead to potential fines and loss of user trust.
      - If users cannot withdraw consent easily, it would be non-compliant as the withdrawal of consent must be as easy as giving it. This could also negatively impact user trust and engagement.
      - If granular consent was mandatory, the current policy would need to be updated to provide clear options for each category of cookie and its purpose. This would enhance transparency and control for users.
      - If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, it would be non-compliant. Users have a right to know who their data is being shared with under GDPR.
      - If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards, it would be non-compliant as per GDPR rules. Appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) or the use of Privacy Shield certified companies must be in place for such transfers.

   - Final Justification: The current policy falls short of meeting all the requirements of the GDPR, particularly in terms of explicit consent for non-essential cookies, transparency regarding third-party data sharing, and international data transfer safeguards.

   - Suggestions for Improvement:
     1. Clearly state that consent is required for non-essential cookies.
     2. Provide detailed information on data sharing with third parties, including the identities of these parties if possible.

Main Compliance Analysis:
- Explicit consent is obtained, but the policy could be clearer about which specific cookies are set and their purpose.
- Users can withdraw consent by adjusting cookie settings, but it's not immediately apparent (improvement suggestions below).
- Granular consent is partially implemented, as users can choose from essential, comfort, statistics, marketing/self-promotion, and advertising partners options. However, the granularity could be improved further.
- Data sharing with third parties is transparently disclosed, but it would be better to provide this information earlier in the policy.
- There's no explicit mention of safeguards for data transfer to non-EU countries, which is a requirement under GDPR (improvement suggestions below).

Counterfactual Impact:
1. If explicit consent was not obtained, it would result in non-compliance with the GDPR and potential fines or legal action.
2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, it would create frustration for the users and potentially lead to a loss of trust in the company, as well as potential legal issues under GDPR.
3. If granular consent was mandatory, the policy would need to provide more detailed information about each type of cookie and its purpose, allowing users to make more informed decisions about their consent.
4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, it would be non-compliant with GDPR, as users must be informed about such practices and have the right to object.
5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards, it would likely result in non-compliance with GDPR, as appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the Privacy Shield) must be in place for such transfers.

Final Justification: The policy provides a basis for obtaining consent but could benefit from improvements in transparency, granularity, and clarity around data transfer practices.

Suggestions for Improvement:
- Clearly explain the purpose of each cookie type used on the website.
- Make it easier for users to withdraw their consent by providing a clear link or option within the policy itself.
- Consider implementing more granular consent options, allowing users to choose which specific cookies they allow.
- Explicitly state the safeguards in place for data transfers to non-EU countries, if any. If no safeguards are in place, consider implementing them or reconsidering data transfer practices."

   Main Compliance Analysis:
     1. Explicit and informed consent is required for non-essential cookies under GDPR, which the policy seems to be fulfilling by providing a 'Accept all cookies' option. However, it doesn't specify if users were previously notified or given information about the specific cookies that will be set (non-essential ones).
     2. While the policy provides an option to withdraw consent, the ease of doing so may not meet GDPR standards if users find the process cumbersome or confusing.
     3. Granular consent, where users can select individual cookies, is encouraged but not mandated under GDPR. The presence of a 'Accept all cookies' option suggests that granular consent might not be provided.
     4. Transparency regarding data sharing with third parties is adequate, as the policy mentions data transfer and provides links to privacy policy for more information.
     5. Since no information about data transfer to non-EU countries is provided, compliance in this regard cannot be assessed without additional information.

   Counterfactual Impact:
     1. Non-obtaining of explicit consent could lead to potential fines under GDPR, as well as legal issues due to the use of cookies without user approval.
     2. Difficulty in withdrawing consent may lead to dissatisfaction among users, as they would have limited control over their data, and potentially increased risks for non-compliance if the withdrawal process is not straightforward.
     3. Mandatory granular consent would provide users with more control and transparency, ensuring that they understand exactly which cookies are being used and why. However, it may also make the cookie settings more complex and time-consuming to manage.
     4. Not being transparent about data sharing with third parties could result in fines under GDPR for lack of consent, as well as potential loss of user trust due to perceived deceit or lack of transparency.
     5. Transferring personal data to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield) could lead to legal issues and fines under GDPR.

   Final Justification: While the policy does provide an option for users to withdraw consent, the ease of doing so and explicit consent for non-essential cookies remain questionable. In addition, no information about data transfer to non-EU countries is provided.

   Suggestions for Improvement: To ensure compliance with GDPR, the following actions could be taken:
     1. Provide clear and specific information about each cookie (non-essential ones) before obtaining consent.
     2. Make the process of withdrawing consent easy to understand and implement.

   - However, explicit consent for each individual cookie is not obtained. Also, the ease of withdrawing consent could be improved.

   Counterfactual Impact:
   1. If explicit consent was not obtained, it would be non-compliant with GDPR as it requires a clear and affirmative action from the user to consent to data processing.
   2. If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, this could lead to a breach of the user's rights under GDPR, which include the right to withdraw consent at any time.
   3. If granular consent was mandatory, it would necessitate obtaining explicit consent for each individual cookie or function, making the process more complex but ensuring greater transparency and control for users.
   4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, this could potentially be non-compliant as GDPR requires clear and concise information about who personal data will be shared with.
   5. Data transfer to non-EU countries without safeguards would be a breach of GDPR, which stipulates that appropriate safeguards must be in place for such transfers.

   Final Justification: The policy provides some key information and offers users the ability to choose their cookie preferences. However, it does not meet all the requirements of GDPR as explicit consent is not obtained for each individual cookie and withdrawing consent could be made easier.

   Suggestions for Improvement:
   - Obtain explicit consent for each individual cookie or function.

      - The policy provides clear categories of cookies (Essential and Statistics), which is a good start for transparency. However, it does not provide detailed information about each category of cookie, such as the specific data collected or the third parties with whom the data might be shared. This falls short of GDPR's requirement for explicit, informed consent.
      - The policy allows users to accept all cookies at once but does not offer a simple way to withdraw consent. This contradicts the GDPR principle that it must be as easy to withdraw consent as it was to give it.
      - The policy does not mandate granular consent, which would require users to explicitly agree to each type of cookie separately. While this is not strictly required under GDPR, providing such an option would enhance transparency and user control.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
      - If explicit consent was not obtained (e.g., by offering a pre-ticked box), the policy would be non-compliant, as users would not have actively chosen to accept cookies. This could lead to potential fines or legal challenges.
      - If users cannot withdraw their consent easily, they may feel a lack of control over their data and potentially seek alternative websites, impacting user engagement and trust.
      - Mandating granular consent would provide more transparency and control for users, enhancing trust and potentially increasing user engagement due to the perceived respect for privacy.

   - Main Compliance Analysis: The policy provides a clear statement about the use of cookies, their purpose (analysis, performance, marketing, individual marketing), and offers users control over their cookie settings. However, it does not specify how users can withdraw consent easily nor does it provide transparency regarding data sharing with third parties or transfer to non-EU countries.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
    1. Non-Compliance (if explicit consent was not obtained): This would be a breach of GDPR as it requires clear and affirmative actions to obtain user consent for non-essential cookies. Users may lose trust, and enforcement agencies could impose fines.
    2. Impact (if users cannot withdraw consent easily): Difficulty in revoking consent could lead to continued data processing without the user's knowledge or consent, potentially violating GDPR principles. This might also negatively impact user experience and trust.
    3. Compliance Change (if granular consent was mandatory): The current policy offers some degree of granular control over cookie settings, but it does not provide separate consent options for each type of cookie (analysis, performance, marketing, individual marketing). To comply with GDPR's requirement for granular consent, the policy should offer distinct consent options.
    4. Non-Compliance (if data sharing with third parties was not transparent): Lack of transparency regarding data sharing with third parties violates Article 13 of GDPR, which requires clear communication about processing activities. Enforcement agencies could impose fines, and users may lose trust.
    5. Non-Compliance (if data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards): Transferring personal data to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield) violates Article 46 of GDPR. This could result in enforcement actions and data subjects' loss of trust.
   - Final Justification: The policy falls short of GDPR requirements regarding transparency, providing mechanisms for easy withdrawal of consent, and data protection when sharing with third parties and transferring data to non-EU countries.
   - Suggestions for Improvement:
    1. Explicitly ask for users' explicit consent before setting non-essential cookies.
    2. Make it easier for users to withdraw their consent, such as providing clear instructions and an accessible 'withdraw consent' option.
    3. Offer granular control over cookie settings, allowing users to choose which types of cookies they accept.
    4. Provide transparent information about data sharing with third parties, including the names of those involved.

   - Main Compliance Analysis: The cookie policy provides information about the use of cookies and offers users the choice to accept or decline non-essential cookies. However, it does not clearly specify how explicit consent is obtained for data processing activities. Furthermore, while there is an option to withdraw consent by adjusting preferences, the ease of doing so could be improved. The policy also mentions data transfer to non-EU countries (USA and China) but does not explicitly state if appropriate safeguards are in place.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
      1. If explicit consent was not obtained, this would lead to non-compliance as GDPR requires that users must give clear and affirmative consent for data processing activities.
      2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, it could potentially infringe upon the user's rights under GDPR, making the policy non-compliant.
      3. If granular consent was mandatory, the current policy would need to be updated to provide more detailed and specific options for consent, as the current ""Accept all"" and ""Only essential"" choices do not offer sufficient granularity.
      4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, this would also lead to non-compliance, as GDPR requires clear and concise information about any sharing of personal data with third parties.
      5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards, this would be a breach of GDPR regulations, which require appropriate safeguards for transfers outside the EU.
   - Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant as it offers users choices regarding cookies and provides some information about data processing activities. However, it falls short in terms of explicit consent, ease of withdrawing consent, and transparency about third-party data sharing and data transfer to non-EU countries.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: To improve compliance, the following actions could be taken:
     1. Clearly specify how explicit consent is obtained for all data processing activities.
     2. Simplify the process of withdrawing consent and ensure it is easy for users to do so.
     3. Provide granular options for consent, allowing users to choose specific types of data processing activities they agree to.

   - Main Compliance Analysis: The policy provides information about the use of cookies, consent options, data storage duration, and rights to revoke consent. However, it lacks transparency in third-party data sharing and adequate explanation for data transfer to non-EU countries.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
    1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the policy would be Non-Compliant as GDPR requires explicit and informed consent from users before processing their personal data. This may lead to fines and damage to reputation.
    2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, the policy would be Partially Compliant since it provides a means to revoke consent but does not ensure ease of access or simplicity in the process. This could result in user frustration and potential legal repercussions.
    3. If granular consent was mandatory, the policy would need to be updated to allow users to give individual consent for each purpose and function, as required by GDPR. This would improve transparency and user control over their data.
    4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, the policy would be Non-Compliant since GDPR requires clear and concise information about who will process personal data and for what purposes. Lack of transparency may lead to users being unaware of how their data is shared and used.
    5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without safeguards, the policy would be Non-Compliant since GDPR requires appropriate safeguards for personal data transferred outside the EU. This could result in fines, legal challenges, and damage to the company's reputation.

However, it lacks clarity on some key points such as whether explicit consent was obtained for processing activities that do not require user consent (e.g., necessary cookies), and transparency regarding data transfer to non-EU countries.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. If explicit consent was not obtained, the processing would be non-compliant as GDPR requires explicit and informed consent for any form of data processing. This could result in significant fines and reputational damage.
     2. If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, the policy would be non-compliant as GDPR stipulates that the withdrawal of consent must be as easy as granting it. This would also lead to potential fines and loss of user trust.
     3. Making granular consent mandatory would improve transparency and user control but might negatively impact user experience due to the increased number of choices and potentially slower website load times.
     4. Lack of transparency about data sharing with third parties would be non-compliant as GDPR requires clear information regarding data recipients, including third parties. This could result in fines and damage to the company's reputation.
     5. Transferring personal data to non-EU countries without adequate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield) would be non-compliant under GDPR, leading to potential legal action and penalties.
   - Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements, but it requires further clarification on some points for full compliance. Specifically, the policy should clearly indicate whether explicit consent was obtained for necessary processing activities and provide transparency regarding data transfer to non-EU countries.
   - Suggestions for Improvement:
     1. Clarify whether explicit consent was obtained for necessary processing activities.
     2. Clearly state data transfer methods used for data sent to non-EU countries, ensuring compliance with GDPR through appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield).
     3. Provide more information about the purposes for which personal data is being processed and the specific legal basis for each processing activity.
     4. Make it easier for users to understand and navigate the consent management system, ensuring that all necessary information is clearly presented.

Furthermore, the policy does not clearly state that users can withdraw consent easily, which is a requirement under GDPR.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. If explicit consent was not obtained, it would make the policy non-compliant with GDPR as users have not actively accepted marketing cookies. This could potentially lead to fines or legal action.
     2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, this would violate the principle of transparency and accountability under GDPR, making the policy non-compliant. It could also lead to user dissatisfaction and potential loss of trust.
     3. If granular consent was mandatory, the current policy would need significant modifications as users must be able to actively accept or reject each category of cookies. This would make the policy compliant with GDPR.
     4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, it would violate the principle of transparency under GDPR, making the policy non-compliant. It could also lead to users being unaware of how their data is being shared and potentially impact user trust.

   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. If explicit consent was not obtained, this would render the policy non-compliant with GDPR as it requires clear and affirmative action from the user.
     2. If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, it may violate the right to access, modify, or remove personal data (Article 15-17 of GDPR).
     3. If granular consent were mandatory, the policy would need to offer more options for users to selectively accept different types of cookies, in accordance with GDPR guidelines.
     4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, it could breach Article 12 and 13's requirements for clear and concise information about data processing activities.
     5. If data transfer to non-EU countries occurred without appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the Privacy Shield), it would be a violation of GDPR.
   - Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it acknowledges the use of cookies and offers an option to reject all cookies, but it does not provide clear and unambiguous consent for non-essential cookies nor make it easy for users to withdraw their consent.

However, it lacks explicit mention of data sharing with third parties and the details of data transfer to non-EU countries.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
    1. Non-obtaining of explicit consent for all cookies would make the policy non-compliant, as GDPR requires explicit consent for non-essential cookies. This could lead to fines and reputational damage.
    2. If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, this would be a violation of GDPR's principle of ""easiness"" in giving and withdrawing consent. This could potentially lead to user dissatisfaction and potential legal action.
    3. Making granular consent mandatory would require more specific and detailed information about each type of cookie, which is currently not provided in the policy. This would make the policy more compliant but would require additional work to ensure all required details are included.
    4. Not being transparent about data sharing with third parties would be a violation of GDPR, as users have the right to know about any such sharing. This could lead to fines and user distrust.
    5. Transferring data to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield) would be a breach of GDPR, potentially leading to fines and legal action.

Additionally, users are informed about the risk of data processing in the USA but do not have the option to explicitly opt-out of this type of data processing.
   - Counterfactual Impact:
      - 1. If explicit consent was not obtained, it would lead to non-compliance as obtaining user's consent is mandatory under GDPR.
      - 2. If users cannot withdraw consent easily, it would negatively impact compliance since the withdrawal of consent is a fundamental right for data subjects under GDPR.
      - 3. Making granular consent mandatory would require additional changes to ensure that users can make individual choices about the types of cookies and third-party services they accept or reject, which is currently not provided in this policy.
      - 4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, it could lead to non-compliance as transparency about such activities is crucial under GDPR.
      - 5. Without proper safeguards for data transfer to non-EU countries, the compliance would be questionable as data subjects have a right to know if their personal data will be transferred outside of the EU and under what conditions.

   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. Non-obtained explicit consent for non-necessary cookies would make the policy non-compliant, as users should be prompted and give consent before these cookies are used.

   3. Mandatory granular consent: If granular consent were mandatorily offered, it would require the organization to further refine its consent mechanism to offer more detailed choices and ensure users understand each option. This could improve transparency but may also make the process more complex and time-consuming for users.
   4. Opaque data sharing with third parties: If data sharing practices with third parties were not transparent, users might feel their privacy is being compromised, potentially damaging trust in the organization and leading to reputational harm.

     3. Making granular consent mandatory would make the policy fully compliant, since it allows users to choose which categories of cookies they accept.
     4. Lack of transparency in data sharing with third parties could result in non-compliance, as users must be informed about the specific purposes and locations of these parties.
     5. Transferring data to non-EU countries without appropriate safeguards would also lead to non-compliance, as such transfers should be governed by EU-approved mechanisms.
   - Final Justification: The policy only partially complies with GDPR due to its lack of clarity about the need for explicit consent and the insufficient transparency regarding third-party data sharing.
   - Suggestions for Improvement:
    1. Clearly state that users must provide explicit consent for each category of cookie.
    2. Provide detailed information about the specific purposes and locations of third parties with whom data is shared.
    3. Implement measures to ensure adequate safeguards for any data transfers to non-EU countries."
counterfactual_scenario,partially-compliant,partially_compliant_7.docx,mistral:latest," Classification: Partially Compliant

Main Compliance Analysis:
1. The cookie policy informs users about the use of cookies, data processing purposes, and provides options for adjusting preferences, which aligns with GDPR requirements. However, it does not explicitly specify that consent is required to store or access non-essential cookies on a user's device, making it partially compliant.
2. The option to change settings and manage cookies is present, thus ensuring users can easily withdraw their consent if needed.
3. While granular consent is not mandatory under GDPR, the policy provides options for managing preferences, which can help achieve a more granular level of consent when required.
4. Data sharing with third parties (e.g., Facebook, YouTube, Google Ads) is transparently disclosed in the policy, ensuring users are informed about potential data transfers to these services. However, it would be beneficial to provide additional information on any specific data processing agreements or safeguards in place for such transfers.
5. The policy provides a notice regarding data processing in the USA, as required by GDPR when transferring personal data to third countries without adequate protection. This is a step towards compliance; however, it does not specify whether appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield) are in place, making it partially compliant on this point as well.

Counterfactual Impact:
1. If explicit consent was not obtained, it would result in non-compliance with GDPR since user consent is crucial for lawful data processing under the regulation.
2. If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, they might perceive a lack of control over their personal data and potential breach of trust, which could negatively impact the relationship between the website and its users.
3. Mandatory granular consent would require providing more detailed information about each category of cookie and their purposes, giving users more control over the data processing activities carried out with their data. This could lead to a better understanding of how their data is being used and a potential increase in user trust.
4. Lack of transparency regarding data sharing with third parties could result in increased risk of unauthorized data processing and potential breaches, as well as fines under GDPR for non-compliance.
5. Transferring personal data to non-EU countries without safeguards would expose the website to substantial risks, such as access by foreign authorities, breaches of user privacy, and legal action under GDPR.

Final Justification:
The policy partially complies with GDPR due to some transparency issues regarding data processing activities, third-party data sharing, and data transfer to non-EU countries without specifying the safeguards in place. It is essential to address these concerns to ensure full compliance with GDPR and maintain user trust.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Explicitly specify that consent is required for non-essential cookies.
2. Provide additional information about data processing agreements or safeguards for third-party data transfers (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses, Privacy Shield).
3. Clarify the presence of safeguards for data transfers to non-EU countries in case they occur.
4. Consider offering more granular consent options to users when possible."
counterfactual_scenario,partially-compliant,partially_compliant_8.docx,mistral:latest," - Classification: Partially Compliant
   - Main Compliance Analysis: The policy provides clear information about the use of cookies, types of cookies, and user consent. However, it lacks explicit mention of data transfer to non-EU countries (Article 49 GDPR) and safeguards for such transfers. Also, there is no clear statement regarding how third parties may access or process personal data (Article 13 GDPR).
   - Counterfactual Impact:
     1. If explicit consent was not obtained, it would render the policy non-compliant with GDPR as obtaining informed and unambiguous consent is essential (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR).
     2. If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, it could breach Article 7(3) GDPR which states that individuals have the right to withdraw consent at any time. This lack of ease in revoking consent may lead to complaints and potential fines.
     3. If granular consent was mandatory, the policy would need to be updated to offer users the option to select specific categories of cookies they agree to.
     4. If data sharing with third parties was not transparent, it could violate Articles 12-14 GDPR which require clear and concise information about the processing of personal data, who receives this data, and what purposes the data will be used for.
     5. Without proper safeguards for data transfer to non-EU countries (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield), the policy would not comply with Article 46 GDPR which dictates that transfers of personal data must be subject to appropriate safeguards.
   - Final Justification: The cookie policy provides some necessary components but fails to meet all requirements under GDPR, particularly those concerning third parties and data transfer.
   - Suggestions for Improvement: Include a section detailing the transfer of personal data to non-EU countries and any safeguards implemented, clearly state how third parties may access or process personal data, provide options for granular consent, and ensure that users can easily revoke their consent."

   Main Compliance Analysis:
   - The policy informs users about the purposes of using cookies, provides options to choose, and allows users to withdraw consent. However, it does not clearly obtain explicit consent for all cookies due to the ""Allow All"" option.
   - The policy provides a method for users to withdraw consent but does not specify whether this can be done easily and straightforwardly.
   - Granular consent is partially implemented, as users can choose between three options: Allow All, Only Necessary Allow, or More Options. However, the ""More Options"" section does not seem to offer granular control over every specific cookie.
   - Data processing providers are clearly listed, but it is unclear whether third-party data sharing is transparent for all cookies.
   - The policy mentions that data transfer to non-EU countries may occur, but it is not specified if safeguards are in place to ensure compliance with GDPR regulations.

   Counterfactual Impact:
   1. Non-explicit consent: If explicit consent was not obtained, the policy would be non-compliant, as GDPR requires explicit and informed consent for all non-essential cookies. This could lead to potential fines or legal disputes.
   2. Difficulty in withdrawing consent: If users cannot easily withdraw their consent, this would impact compliance, as GDPR requires that the withdrawal of consent must be as easy as granting it.
   3. Mandatory granular consent: If granular consent was mandatory, the policy would need to offer more options for individual cookie control to comply with GDPR requirements.
   4. Opaque third-party data sharing: If data sharing with third parties is not transparent for all cookies, this would negatively impact compliance, as GDPR requires clear and concise information about how data is shared.
   5. Lack of safeguards for international data transfer: If data transfer to non-EU countries occurs without appropriate safeguards, this would be a violation of GDPR regulations.

   Final Justification: The cookie policy provides some level of compliance by informing users about the purposes of using cookies and offering options to choose. However, it does not obtain explicit consent for all cookies, make granular control over cookies easy, or ensure full transparency in data sharing with third parties and international data transfer.

   Suggestions for Improvement:
   - Obtain explicit consent for all non-essential cookies.
   - Make it easier for users to withdraw their consent and provide a clear method for doing so.
   - Offer granular control over individual cookies within the ""More Options"" section.
   - Ensure transparency in data sharing with third parties for all cookies.
   - Implement appropriate safeguards for international data transfer, such as standard contractual clauses or the EU-US Privacy Shield."

    - Implement a mechanism for notifying users when significant changes are made to the cookie policy or their preferences."
legal_analysis,compliant,compliant-14.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Legal Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, but the pre-ticked ""Accept All"" option may not meet the GDPR requirement for informed and unambiguous consent (Article 7(4)). The user needs to actively select the options.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can change their cookie settings at any time.
     - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, as users are given three choices but the ""Accept All"" option includes marketing and social network cookies that may not be strictly necessary (Article 5(3)).
     - Data Transparency: Yes, users are informed about the purposes of each type of cookie.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, with clarity as partners are involved in data processing for marketing and analysis.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the policy doesn't clearly state that consent is ""specific, informed and unambiguous"" (Article 4(11)).
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as users are given a choice but the pre-selected ""Accept All"" option may not meet the GDPR requirement for freely given consent.

4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR as it provides some control over data use but fails to ensure truly informed and freely given consent due to the pre-ticked ""Accept All"" option.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Remove the pre-selected ""Accept All"" option and require active selection of each category.
   - Clearly state that consent is specific, informed, and unambiguous as required by Article 4(11).
   - Provide more information about how data will be used and ensure that all cookies are necessary or essential unless explicitly declared otherwise.
   - Ensure transparency in third-party data handling, including partners' identities if possible."
legal_analysis,compliant,compliant-15.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Legal Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user is asked to give consent before cookies are activated. The legal basis for processing personal data is Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR, as the processing is based on the user's clear and affirmative action (consent).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can withdraw their consent at any time via ""Cookie Settings.""
     - Granular Consent: Yes, the policy provides a granular approach to consent, allowing users to choose which categories of cookies they want to allow.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, some level of transparency is provided as the user is informed about the purpose of each category of cookie. However, more detailed information could be added for full compliance (e.g., retention periods, third-party data handling).
  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant] The policy uses a definition of consent that aligns with the GDPR's requirements for clear and affirmative action.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] While users are given the opportunity to give and withdraw their consent, additional information could be provided to ensure it is freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. This could include more detailed explanations of each category of cookie and its purpose, as well as the potential impact on the user's privacy.
  4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements for cookie consent, providing users with an option to give or withdraw consent and a granular approach to managing their preferences. However, it falls short in fully meeting Article 7's conditions for consent due to insufficient information about each category of cookie.
  5. Suggested Enhancements:
     - Add more detailed explanations of each category of cookie (e.g., its purpose, the data collected, and the third-parties involved) to ensure that consent is specific, informed, and unambiguous.
     - Clarify the consequences of accepting or rejecting cookies (e.g., what features will be available/unavailable with each choice).
     - Update the policy to provide information about data retention periods for each category of cookie.
     - Incorporate a mechanism for periodically reminding users about their consent choices and offering them the opportunity to update or revoke their selections."
legal_analysis,compliant,compliant-16.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Legal Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, users are asked to give their consent for each category of cookies (technically necessary, statistics/range measurement, marketing) before they are set. The legal basis is the user's consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can withdraw their consent at any time by changing their cookie preferences in the Cookie Settings.
     - Granular Consent: Yes, users are given options to accept all cookies, reject non-essential cookies, or customize their preferences, providing a granular level of control over which cookies they allow.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, users are provided with information about the purpose, recipient, and storage duration of each type of cookie, as well as the potential risks associated with specific third-party cookies.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, the policy discloses that third-party cookies (e.g., LinkedIn retargeting cookies) are used and stored in countries outside of the EU (USA), which is crucial for ensuring transparency but could potentially raise issues under GDPR due to the lack of adequate data protection measures in those jurisdictions.

  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Compliant, as the policy defines consent as ""any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data.""
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Non-Compliant, as the policy does not provide sufficient information about the purpose and duration of the data processing, making it difficult for users to fully understand the implications of their consent. Additionally, the policy does not state whether or how children's consent is obtained, which is essential under Article 7(3) GDPR.

  4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements by asking users for explicit consent and providing a withdrawal mechanism. However, it fails to meet the transparency standards set out in Articles 4(11) and 7 by not providing comprehensive information about the purpose, duration, and legal basis of data processing.

  5. Suggested Enhancements: To meet GDPR compliance requirements, the policy should be updated as follows:
     - Provide a clear explanation of the purpose, duration, and legal basis for each type of data processing (e.g., ""Technically Necessary Cookies are used to enable core website functions and are necessary for the provision of our service. We process this data on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR – contract fulfillment."")
     - Inform users about the measures taken to protect their data when it is transferred outside of the EU (e.g., by using standard contractual clauses or Privacy Shield certification).
     - Clarify the information regarding children's consent, stating that cookies are not used for children under 16 years old without verifiable parental consent.
     - Ensure that all information is presented in clear and plain language, making it easy for users to understand their options and the implications of their choices."

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user is presented with a clear choice to accept or reject cookies, providing explicit consent for the use of non-essential cookies. The legal basis for processing personal data using cookies is Article 6(1)(a) – Consent of the data subject.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, the user can withdraw their consent at any time by modifying cookie settings. However, it would be more effective to provide a clear mechanism for revoking consent on each instance where cookies are used.
     - Granular Consent: Yes, users have an option to accept only necessary cookies or customize their preferences using the ""Cookie Settings"" option. This meets the granularity requirement as users can choose which types of cookies they want to allow.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides information about the different types of cookies used and their purposes. However, it could be improved by specifying the retention period for cookies and the third parties involved in data handling.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, it is mentioned that targeted advertising cookies involve third-party data handling. However, more clarity is needed about who these third parties are and their role in cookie processing.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Compliant, as the policy defines consent as any freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which they, by a statement or clear affirmative action, signify agreement to the processing of personal data relating to them.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant, as users are provided with clear and concise information about the purpose of data processing, and their consent is separate from other terms and conditions. However, the policy could benefit from better specifying the retention period for cookies and providing more detailed information on third-party data handling.

4. Final Justification: The cookie policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it provides users with an option to give or withdraw consent regarding the use of cookies. However, it needs further clarification about third-party data handling and improved transparency concerning retention periods for cookies.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly specify the duration for which non-essential cookies will be stored on a user's device.
   - Provide more detailed information on the third parties involved in cookie processing, including their roles and how they process personal data.
   - Implement a mechanism that allows users to easily revoke their consent for individual cookies or cookie categories at any time while browsing the website.
   - Ensure the policy is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in the website's use of cookies and any updates to relevant GDPR guidance."
legal_analysis,compliant,compliant-18.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Legal Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user is presented with three options to choose from (Accept All, Only Technically Necessary, and Settings), implying a choice to accept or reject cookies. The ""Accept All"" option provides consent for all types of cookies. However, it's not explicit as users might not be fully aware of what they are consenting to.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, the user can change their preferences at any time by revisiting the Cookie Settings (Settings option).
     - Granular Consent: Partially, as only two categories of cookies (Performance & Analytics and Marketing & Personalization) have explicit options to accept or reject. The ""Accept All"" option does not provide granular control over individual cookies.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, some information about the purpose of each category of cookie is provided. However, more specific details about the types of cookies used, their retention periods, and the third parties involved would be beneficial for increased transparency.
  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the information provided does not clearly inform users that by giving consent for non-essential cookies, they are accepting data processing activities beyond what is necessary for the website's basic function.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as the user has the option to accept or reject cookies, but more transparency and granular control over individual cookies would be required to meet GDPR requirements.
  4. Final Justification: The Cookie Policy partially complies with GDPR because it provides a mechanism for users to accept or reject cookies, but it lacks sufficient transparency and granular control over the types of cookies used. This could lead to confusion about the scope of data processing activities the user is agreeing to.
  5. Suggested Enhancements:
     - Provide more detailed information about the types of cookies used (session, persistent, first-party, third-party), their retention periods, and their purposes within each category.
     - Offer granular control over individual cookies within each category to meet the GDPR requirement for explicit consent.
     - Clarify the scope of data processing activities the user is agreeing to by providing explicit information about what data will be collected, how it will be used, and with whom it will be shared.
     - Simplify the language and structure of the Cookie Policy to improve readability and understanding for users."
legal_analysis,compliant,compliant-19.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Legal Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user is given multiple choices to consent or not to cookies and data processing. However, since some cookies are marked as ""Always Active"" (Necessary Cookies), it may be challenging to determine whether explicit consent has been obtained for all data collection activities. The legal basis for these necessary cookies should be clearly stated to ensure compliance with GDPR.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, the user is provided with a mechanism to withdraw their consent via the ""Review and change your consent"" button on the Cookie Policy page.
     - Granular Consent: Partially compliant, as users are given the option to select different categories of cookies but not every cookie can be disabled individually (e.g., Necessary Cookies).
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the user is provided with more information about each cookie category and its purpose. However, there should be more clarity regarding the specific purposes for which personal data will be used.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, it is stated that marketing cookies data may be shared with third-party partners for advertising. However, more transparency should be provided about the identities of these partners and the nature of the data sharing.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Partially compliant, as not all cookies are given based on explicit consent. The legal basis for the necessary cookies should be clarified to meet this requirement.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant, as users are provided with clear and concise information about the processing activities and their choices regarding cookie usage. However, more clarity is needed around the legal basis for the collection of personal data in all cases.

4. Final Justification: The policy partially meets GDPR compliance requirements by providing a mechanism for users to give or withdraw consent for cookies. However, it fails to clearly state the legal basis for all types of cookie usage and does not offer granular control over every cookie, which may raise concerns regarding informed consent and transparency.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly specify the legal basis for necessary cookies, ensuring that they fall under one of the GDPR's six legal bases for data processing (e.g., legitimate interests).
   - Offer more granular control over each cookie and provide users with a clear understanding of how their personal data will be used for specific purposes within each category.
   - Provide greater transparency regarding third-party partners involved in data sharing, including their identities and the nature of the data shared."

     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Non-Compliant (Although users are given an option to accept or decline cookies, there is no evidence that the request for consent is presented in an easily accessible form, with the essence of the processing being clear and separate from other matters)
  4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR as it provides an option for users to give their consent to the use of cookies, and offers a withdrawal mechanism. However, it fails to meet the requirement for transparent and easily accessible request for consent as per Article 7 of the GDPR.
  5. Suggested Enhancements:
    - Clearly separate the request for consent from other matters and ensure it is presented in an easily accessible form.
    - Make sure the essence of the processing is clear to the user before seeking their consent.
    - Consider using a more interactive approach to obtain explicit, affirmative consent that is easy for users to understand.
    - Ensure that the policy provides adequate information about how long cookies will be stored on a user's device and for what purposes.
    - Clarify the options available for managing cookies within the mobile environment, as some mobile operating systems may restrict the use of cookies and similar technologies beyond these settings."
legal_analysis,compliant,compliant-20.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Legal Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user is presented with three options (""Accept everything"", ""Decline"", and ""More"") to give consent for the use of cookies. The ""Accept Everything"" option grants full consent, while the ""Decline"" option accepts only necessary cookies. However, the ""More"" option could be considered as not explicitly granting consent to all types of cookies. (Legal Basis: Article 6(1)(a) - Consent of the data subject).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, the user can change or revoke consent at any time via the cookie settings link. (Justification: Article 7(3) - The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his/her consent at any time.)
     - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, as users can choose between ""Accept Everything"", ""Decline"", and ""More"" options but not all types of cookies are explicitly granted through these options. (Justification: Article 7(2)(a) - Where processing is based on consent, the data subject shall have the right to withdraw his/her consent at any time.)
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the user is informed about the types of cookies used (Functional, Statistics, and Marketing), their purposes, and third-party services involved. However, more information could be provided to improve transparency. (Justification: Article 12 - The controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form.)
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but the level of clarity is not sufficient. More details about data sharing practices with third-party services should be provided to ensure transparency. (Clarity Level: Partially Compliant)

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Non-Compliant + Reason] The definition of consent in the policy does not meet the GDPR requirement of being ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her"". The user is presented with three options, but not all types of cookies are explicitly granted through these options.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant + Reason] The policy complies with Article 7(2) as it offers the option for users to withdraw their consent at any time and provides information about the processing of personal data. However, the granularity of consent could be improved as not all types of cookies are explicitly granted through the options presented.

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR requirements as it offers the option for users to give and withdraw their consent regarding cookie usage, but it could benefit from enhancing the transparency and granularity of the consent mechanism to ensure full compliance.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly label each type of cookie (Functional, Statistics, Marketing) within the ""More"" option, so users can explicitly grant consent for each category.
   - Provide more detailed information about data sharing practices with third-party services involved in cookie handling to ensure transparency and improve user understanding.
   - Revise the definition of consent to ensure it meets GDPR requirements, offering a clear affirmative action that unambiguously signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to the user."

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user is presented with two options for consent (""Edit or Decline"" and ""Accept All""). However, the ""Accept All"" option does not comply with GDPR as it does not allow users to separate their consent regarding essential cookies (always active) from non-essential cookies. The legal basis for processing personal data should be specified in this case.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can manage their privacy settings or withdraw their consent at any time under “Tracking” in the website footer.
     - Granular Consent: Partially compliant, as users cannot separate their consent for essential cookies from non-essential cookies.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides information about data processing purposes and third-party vendors involved. However, more details on specific data retention periods and the purpose of advanced features (geolocation data, device scanning) are needed to ensure full transparency.
  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Partially compliant, as the ""Accept All"" option does not provide granular consent in accordance with the GDPR definition of consent (the ability for users to give and withdraw specific types of consent).
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Non-compliant, as the user is presented with only two options, one of which does not comply with the conditions for valid consent.
  4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR because it offers users a mechanism to manage their privacy settings and withdraw consent. However, it fails to provide granular control over non-essential cookies, thus failing to meet the full requirements of GDPR Article 7.
  5. Suggested Enhancements:
     - Clearly specify the legal basis for data processing in addition to offering explicit consent options.
     - Offer granular control over non-essential cookies and ensure users can decline or accept only specific types of cookies (e.g., marketing & advertising, advanced features).
     - Provide more detailed information about data retention periods, the purpose of advanced features, and any potential risks associated with third-party data handling.
     - Ensure that the withdrawal mechanism is user-friendly and accessible throughout the website."

   - Explicit Consent: Yes (the user can accept or manage cookie preferences)
     - Legal Basis: Legitimate Interest (Article 6(1)(f)) in providing a functional website and for marketing purposes, as well as Consent (Article 6(1)(a)) for cookies requiring explicit consent.
   - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes (the user can revoke their consent at any time)
     - Legal Justification: This is necessary to comply with the right to withdraw consent under Article 7(3).
   - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant (granular consent is provided for marketing and analytics cookies but not for required cookies)
     - Justification: Providing granular consent is recommended for transparency, allowing users to make informed decisions about the processing of their data. In this case, granularity is partially met but improvement is needed to achieve full compliance.
   - Data Transparency: Partially Compliant (the policy discloses the use of cookies and provides a link to the privacy policy for more information)
     - Justification: Improvement is necessary in providing clear and concise information about what specific data is being collected, processed, or shared with third parties.
   - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes (third-party services are used for marketing purposes)

  3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant
     - Reason: The definition of consent provided in the policy does not meet the GDPR standard, as it does not explicitly state that the data subject has freely given specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of their wishes.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant
     - Reason: While a mechanism for obtaining consent is provided, the policy does not clearly disclose the specific purposes and legal basis for processing data or specify the retention period. Additionally, granularity is only partially met.

     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can revoke their consent at any time, as stated in the policy.
     - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, users have the option to accept or deny certain categories of cookies but not individual cookies within those categories.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, some information is provided about the purpose of data processing and third-party service providers, but further clarity on specific cookies and their purpose is lacking.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, with the use of services like Google Analytics, Google Ads Conversion Tracking, LinkedIn Analytics, walls.io, and YouTube Video. The level of clarity provided is moderate; it's clear that third parties are involved but not the specific purposes or data processing activities carried out by those third parties.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, while the policy mentions consent, it does not provide a clear and affirmative action by which the user indicates their agreement to the processing of personal data. The ""Accept all"" button represents a passive agreement rather than an active affirmative action as required under GDPR.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, users are given the opportunity to give consent and can revoke it at any time, but the granularity of consent is not sufficient as they cannot give or withdraw consent for individual cookies.

4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements as it provides a mechanism for giving and withdrawing consent and offers some transparency about data processing activities. However, it falls short in meeting the strict criteria for obtaining explicit consent by not providing a clear affirmative action for users to indicate agreement, and by not offering granular control over individual cookies.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Provide a clear and affirmative action for users to give their explicit consent for data processing activities.
   - Offer granular control over individual cookies rather than just categories of cookies.
   - Clarify the specific purposes and data processing activities carried out by third-party service providers.
   - Consider revising the policy to ensure compliance with Article 4(11) of the GDPR regarding consent definitions."

2. Legal Justification:
   - Explicit Consent: Yes, users are asked to give their voluntary consent. However, it's not entirely clear which cookies require consent and which do not (as per the distinction between ""Technically required only"" and ""Agree to all"" categories). The legal basis for processing is not explicitly stated.
   - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can revoke their consent at any time. However, it's not clear how this affects previously collected data or if the withdrawal of consent would cause functionalities to be impaired.
   - Granular Consent: Partially. Users can choose which categories of cookies they agree to, but it's not clear whether all necessary information is provided for each category (e.g., purpose, third-party involvement).
   - Data Transparency: Yes, some information about the purposes of the cookies and partners involved is provided. However, more detailed information may be needed to ensure full transparency, especially for third-party cookies.
   - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, third-party cookies are used. Clarity Level: A list of services that use third-party cookies is provided, but more specific information about the nature and purpose of data handling by these third parties would be beneficial.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant. The policy does not provide a concise, easily accessible statement that explains what constitutes consent under this definition.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant. Users are given the opportunity to give their consent and can revoke it at any time, but it's unclear whether the information provided meets the clarity and conciseness requirements of Article 7(4).

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it provides some information about the use of cookies and offers a means to withdraw consent. However, it falls short in providing a clear, concise definition of consent, explaining all necessary information for each category of cookie, and ensuring transparency regarding third-party data handling.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly define what constitutes consent under Article 4(11) within the policy.
   - Provide more detailed information about each category of cookie, including its purpose, any third-party involvement, and potential impact on website functionality if the user chooses to opt out.
   - Ensure that the withdrawal mechanism not only allows users to revoke their consent but also explains the consequences of doing so (e.g., functionalities that may be impaired or previously collected data that may still be used).
   - Provide more specific information about the nature and purpose of data handling by third parties involved in the use of cookies on the website."

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user is explicitly asked to give consent for non-essential cookies. However, it lacks clarity regarding the legal basis for processing sensitive data such as location and advertising purposes.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can withdraw their consent at any time by adjusting their settings.
     - Granular Consent: Yes, users are given options to choose which types of cookies they accept.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides some information about data processing methods and third-party partners. However, it could be more transparent about the specific types of data being collected, processed, and shared.
  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, the policy does not explicitly state that consent is ""freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous"". The language used (""By clicking ‘Agree’, you consent..."") may be interpreted as coercive.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant, users are provided with clear information about the processing activities and can freely give their consent.
  4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR as it provides some options for user consent and withdrawal of consent. However, it could be improved to ensure that the language used for consent is unambiguous and that users are fully informed about the types of data being collected and processed.
  5. Suggested Enhancements:
    - Clarify the legal basis for processing sensitive data such as location and advertising purposes.
    - Use clear, unambiguous language when asking for user consent.
    - Provide more detailed information about the specific types of data being collected, processed, and shared with third parties.
    - Ensure that users are fully informed about their right to withdraw consent at any time and how to do so.
    - Consider using a checkbox system instead of a binary ""Agree"" or ""Decline"" option to allow for more granular consent choices."
legal_analysis,compliant,compliant-30.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Legal Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes (User provides consent by clicking 'Accept all cookies'). The legal basis for processing personal data is the user's consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes (Users can revoke or change their consent at any time in the ""Cookie Settings"" and select individual settings).
     - Granular Consent: Partially (While users are given a choice to accept or deny certain categories of cookies, they are not provided with granular control over each individual cookie).
     - Data Transparency: Yes (Users can learn about the purpose and function of each category of cookies in the privacy policy and under the ""Privacy Settings"").
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes (+ Clarity Level: The third parties are listed, but it could be made clearer that these parties may transfer and process personal data).

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant (While the policy does state that consent is given by clicking 'Accept all cookies', it does not clearly specify that this is a freely given specific and informed indication of the user's wishes).
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant (Users are provided with clear and comprehensive information about the processing activities, and their consent is specific, informed, and unambiguous).

4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements as it provides users with a mechanism to accept or deny cookies, but it does not meet the standards for granular consent outlined in Article 4(11) of the GDPR.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Implement granular control over individual cookies to comply with the requirement for specific and informed consent (Article 4(11)).
   - Clarify the language used to explain how third parties may transfer and process personal data to improve transparency and comply with Article 5(1)(a) GDPR.
   - Review the policy's compliance with Article 13, 14, and 20 of the GDPR regarding information provided, the manner in which this information is presented, and the user's right to access, rectify, erase, or object to processing."

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, users are provided with the option to accept or reject all cookies, including third-party cookies like Google Analytics and YouTube. The legal basis for this is Art. 6(1)(a) DSGVO (Consent).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can change their cookie preferences at any time via the cookie button at the bottom of the website.
     - Granular Consent: Yes, users are given the option to select which categories of cookies they accept or reject.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, users are informed about the purpose and scope of data processing, as well as the possibility of obtaining further information in the data protection information.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, with clear indication that data collected by third-party cookies/functions may also be processed by the respective third parties (Google/YouTube, Inc., Microsoft).

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Compliant. The policy defines consent as any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which they, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signify agreement to the processing of personal data relating to them.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant. The policy meets the requirements of Article 7(2)(a) as it provides a clear and distinct request for consent for each category of cookie, and offers users the ability to easily withdraw their consent at any time.

4. Final Justification: The cookie policy is partially compliant with GDPR, as it provides explicit consent, a withdrawal mechanism, granular consent, data transparency, and clear information about third-party data handling. However, it falls short in terms of fully addressing the concerns raised by the ECJ regarding data protection in the USA.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - To address the concerns raised by the ECJ, consider implementing measures such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) with third-party processors based outside the EU to ensure an adequate level of data protection.
   - Provide additional information about the specific purposes for which personal data will be processed by third parties, beyond the general processing purposes mentioned in the policy.
   - Offer users a more detailed explanation of the risks associated with data processing in countries with insufficient levels of data protection, such as the USA, and provide clear information about how their data will be protected when transferred to these countries."
legal_analysis,compliant,compliant-32.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Legal Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes (implied when user clicks ""Accept All Cookies"") - The legal basis is legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, as the cookies are necessary for the website to function properly and provide enhanced features. However, explicit consent is still required for non-essential cookies under Article 7(4) GDPR since they are used for analytics and marketing purposes.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes - Users can withdraw their consent by changing their cookie settings or the option provided to ""Reject All"". However, the withdrawal mechanism should be more prominent and easily accessible.
     - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant - The policy allows users to control certain categories of cookies but does not provide granular options for each individual cookie. This may not meet the requirements of transparency under GDPR.
     - Data Transparency: Yes - The policy provides information about the types of cookies used, their purposes, and potential third-party data handling. However, it could be improved by providing more specific details on each individual cookie, such as their lifespan and the specific third parties involved.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes + Clarity Level: Low - The policy mentions that data may be transferred to countries outside the EEA without adequate protection and that users may not be able to exercise their rights in relation to this data. However, it does not clearly specify which third parties are involved or provide contact information for these parties to facilitate exercise of data subject rights.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant - The policy's definition of consent is too broad and does not meet the strict conditions under GDPR, which require an unambiguous, informed, freely given indication of the data subject’s wishes.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant - While users are provided with a choice to accept or reject cookies, the policy does not fully meet the requirements of Article 7 as it does not provide granular control over individual cookies and does not clearly specify which cookies are necessary and which are not.

4. Final Justification: The primary reason behind the partial compliance classification is that while the cookie policy provides some information about cookies, it does not meet all the strict requirements under GDPR for consent, transparency, and granular control. To comply fully with GDPR, the policy would need to be revised to provide more detailed information on individual cookies, offer a more prominent withdrawal mechanism, and ensure that explicit, informed consent is obtained for non-essential cookies.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Provide granular control over each individual cookie, explaining their purpose, lifespan, and any potential third-party data handling.
   - Clearly specify which cookies are strictly necessary and which are not, offering a choice between accepting all non-essential cookies or rejecting them entirely.
   - Improve the withdrawal mechanism by making it more prominent on the site and ensuring that users can easily change their preferences at any time.
   - Offer more specific information about third-party data handling, including the parties involved and contact details for exercising data subject rights.
   - Review and revise the definition of consent to ensure it meets the strict conditions under GDPR."

2. Legal Justification:
   - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user is presented with a clear ""Accept all and continue"" button for cookies that require consent under GDPR. However, it is not immediately apparent which cookies fall into this category.
   - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can access and modify their cookie preferences at any time using the ""more settings"" link.
   - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, as users are not explicitly asked for consent to each individual cookie or category of cookies (Marketing, Functional, Essential). Instead, they are given the option to accept all or refuse all.
   - Data Transparency: Yes, detailed information about the individual cookies is provided under ""more settings"". However, this level of detail could be improved for clarity and user-friendliness.
   - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but not sufficiently clearly, as there is no explicit mention of third-party data handling in the cookie policy text.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Partially Compliant, as while the policy does involve the processing of personal data based on user consent, it does not clearly state that this is a ""freely given specific, informed and unambiguous indication of his or her wishes"" in accordance with the definition provided in Article 4(11).
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as while users are given the opportunity to refuse consent, the policy does not explicitly state that refusal to provide consent will not result in any detriment or negative consequences.

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it does not meet all of the requirements for explicit and informed user consent. While users are given the option to accept or refuse cookies, they are not explicitly asked for consent to each individual cookie or category of cookies. This lack of granularity in the consent process may be seen as non-compliant with Article 7 of GDPR.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly label each cookie category (Marketing, Functional, Essential) and provide a brief description of what each category entails.
   - Request explicit consent for each individual cookie or category of cookies, making it clear that refusal to provide consent will not result in any detriment or negative consequences.
   - Clearly state the definition of consent provided in Article 4(11) of GDPR and ensure that the policy meets this definition.
   - Improve the clarity and user-friendliness of the detailed information about individual cookies provided under ""more settings"".
   - Explicitly mention third-party data handling in the cookie policy text, including any relevant details such as the identities of third parties involved and their purposes for processing data."

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user is given an option to either ""Accept All"", ""Deny All"", or adjust settings individually. The legal basis for processing personal data in this case would be consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can revoke or adjust their consent settings at any time through the ""Individual Settings"" option.
     - Granular Consent: Yes, but with room for improvement. Users can selectively allow or deny specific technologies. However, more granular options (e.g., distinguishing between essential and non-essential cookies) might be necessary to comply fully with GDPR requirements.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, users are provided with information about the purposes of data processing, the types of cookies used, and links to the privacy policy and imprint.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but clarity level is unclear. The policy mentions several third-party providers (DoubleClick Floodlight, Meta, Google Ads, LinkedIn, Google Analytics, Snowplow), but it does not explicitly state whether personal data is shared with these parties or how they process the data.

  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Compliant, as the policy definition of consent aligns with the GDPR's definition of ""any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.""
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant, as the policy meets the requirements of being given in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. However, the age verification mechanism seems to be only 16 years old, which might not comply with all member states' laws regarding children's online privacy.

  4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it provides users with the option to give or withdraw their consent and offers some transparency about the purposes of data processing. However, it falls short in providing a comprehensive and easily understandable explanation of third-party data handling, and it might not meet all age verification requirements under the GDPR.

  5. Suggested Enhancements:
     - Clearly state that the policy complies with the GDPR to build trust with users.
     - Improve transparency about third-party data handling by explaining the relationship between Commerzbank and these parties, how personal data is shared, and how the third parties process this data.
     - Implement a more granular consent mechanism, allowing users to easily distinguish between essential and non-essential cookies.
     - Ensure that age verification complies with all member states' laws regarding children's online privacy."

     - Explicit Consent: Yes, but the consent is not specific enough as it does not clearly identify the types of cookies being set or the purposes for which they are used (Article 7(4)). The legal basis for processing is not explicitly stated.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can change their cookie settings at any time.
     - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant. While users can manage their consent preferences, the policy does not provide enough detail about the types of cookies being set or their purposes.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, some information is provided about the use of cookies and how to manage them, but it could be more detailed and user-friendly.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, this is indicated in the ""Services from other companies (autonomous third-party providers)"" section. However, more clarity is needed on who these third parties are and what data they collect.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant. The policy does not use clear and plain language to obtain consent in accordance with the definition provided in Article 4(11).
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant. While users are given the option to manage their cookie preferences, the information provided is not sufficiently specific or detailed.

4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements as it provides a mechanism for managing cookies and offers some transparency about their use. However, it does not meet all the necessary criteria for explicit, informed, and granular consent.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly list and describe the types of cookies used, including those from third parties, along with their purposes.
   - Provide more detailed information about how users can manage their cookie preferences in a user-friendly manner.
   - Explicitly state the legal basis for processing cookies and obtain explicit, informed, and granular consent in accordance with GDPR Article 4(11) and Article 7.

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: No, as the user is not explicitly asked for consent for each category of cookies. Instead, there is an ""Accept All"" option, which does not comply with GDPR requirements of explicit and granular consent. (Legal Basis: Article 6(1)(a) - Consent is needed when the processing operation requires it.)
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can delete or block cookies by adjusting their browser settings at any time. However, this does not seem to be clearly communicated within the cookie policy. (Legal Justification: Article 7(3) - The data subject should be informed of his/her right to withdraw consent at any time.)
     - Granular Consent: No, as there is no option for users to selectively accept or refuse different categories of cookies. (Justification: GDPR requires granular consent for non-essential cookies.)
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the purpose and duration of essential cookies are explained, but it is not clear which third parties have access to the data collected by statistical cookies. (Justification: Articles 12, 13, and 14 require transparency in providing information about processing activities.)
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but clarity level is insufficient as it does not specify which third parties have access to the data collected by statistical cookies. (Clarity Level: Improvement needed for full compliance.)
  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the consent mechanism does not comply with the GDPR definition of consent. The users are only presented with an ""Accept All"" option without the possibility to selectively accept or refuse different categories of cookies.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as explicit and informed consent is required but only presented in a general manner rather than being granular and specific.
  4. Final Justification: The cookie policy is partially compliant with the GDPR because it fails to meet the requirements for explicit, granular, and informed consent, and lacks clarity about third-party data handling.
  5. Suggested Enhancements:
    - Provide separate options for users to accept or refuse essential, statistics, and other non-essential cookies.
    - Clearly explain the purpose of each category of cookie and the third parties that have access to the data collected by those cookies.
    - Inform users about their right to withdraw consent at any time in a more prominent manner within the cookie policy.

     - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, as users are given the option to manage their cookie preferences, but not all types of cookies are explicitly described or clearly distinguishable.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, users are informed about the purpose of using cookies, the transfer of data outside the EEA, and where to find more information in the Privacy Policy.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but the policy does not specify the clarity level regarding third-party data handling.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the policy does not explicitly state that consent is ""specific, informed and unambiguous."" Although users can manage their cookie preferences, the initial acceptance of all cookies may not meet the GDPR's strict requirement for explicit consent.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as users are given the option to accept or reject cookies but may not be fully aware of what they are consenting to due to the lack of granularity in the cookie preferences.

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR because it provides some transparency regarding cookie usage and allows users to manage their preferences, although it could be improved for explicit and informed consent, granularity, and the clarity level in third-party data handling.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly state the legal basis for processing cookies (legitimate interests under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR).
   - Make it more prominent and easily accessible for users to reject all cookies.
   - Provide a clear and easy-to-understand description of each type of cookie used, including third-party cookies, and the purpose they serve.
   - Ensure that the consent process is granular, allowing users to accept or reject specific categories of cookies.
   - Clarify the level of third-party data handling in the policy."

     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially compliant, as users are not provided with granular control over their consent.
  4. Final Justification: The cookie policy partially complies with GDPR due to the presence of a withdrawal mechanism, but it fails to meet the requirements for explicit and granular consent as well as transparency regarding the purpose of each category of cookie. This could potentially lead to issues in demonstrating valid consent under GDPR.
  5. Suggested Enhancements:
     - Clearly define the legal basis for processing cookies (e.g., legitimate interest, contractual necessity) and provide a granular consent mechanism that allows users to selectively consent to specific types of cookies.
     - Improve transparency by detailing the purpose of each category of cookie and providing more clarity about the companies involved and third-party providers.

However, the policy does not provide a specific and unambiguous statement about the purpose of data processing.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, the user can adjust their preferences at any time.
     - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, as users are only given two options (Accept all or Only essential) in the initial consent request. The ""Set preferences"" option provides a more granular level of control, but it is not clearly presented in the policy.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, some information about the types of cookies and their purposes is provided. However, the level of detail could be improved to ensure users fully understand what data will be collected, who it will be shared with, and how it will be used.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, the policy mentions that user data may be processed by third parties such as marketing partners, Facebook, and Google. However, clarity could be improved by specifying the categories of third parties involved and the purpose of data sharing with each one.

  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Partially Compliant, as the consent request does not provide a specific, informed, and unambiguous statement about the purposes of data processing.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as the user is not provided with clear, concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible information about the purposes of data processing, the identity of the data controller, and the recipients or categories of recipients of personal data.

  4. Final Justification: The policy does not fully comply with GDPR requirements because it lacks a clear and detailed description of the purposes of data processing, the legal basis for each purpose, and the specific categories of third parties involved in data sharing. These deficiencies may result in a lack of transparency and informed consent from users.

  5. Suggested Enhancements:
     - Provide a clear and concise statement about the purposes of data processing within the initial consent request.
     - Offer granular control options to users by default, rather than providing only two broad options in the initial consent request.
     - Increase transparency by specifying the categories of third parties involved in data sharing, the purpose of data sharing with each one, and whether any data will be processed outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).
     - Improve the level of detail about the types of cookies used, their purposes, and the specific data they collect.

     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users are informed about their right to revoke consent at any time and are provided with a means to do so within the cookie policy and in the ""Customize"" section.
     - Granular Consent: Yes, users can give their consent individually based on the purposes and functions of cookies.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, users are informed about the purposes for which their data will be processed, the legal basis for processing, and their right to revoke consent at any time. However, it could be improved by providing more detailed information about each purpose, such as the specific types of personal data that will be processed and the duration of processing.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, users are informed that third parties (including partners in connection with the IAB TCF) may process their data. However, it could be improved by providing more clarity about the identities of these third parties and the purposes for which they will process the user's data.

4. Final Justification: The cookie policy is partially compliant with GDPR requirements because it provides users with the opportunity to give or withdraw their consent for the use of cookies, but it could benefit from additional clarifications and improvements in transparency regarding the specific purposes for which data will be processed, the identities of third parties involved, and other relevant details.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Provide more detailed information about each purpose for which consent is sought, including the specific types of personal data that will be processed and the duration of processing.
   - Offer clear and concise explanations about the identities of third parties involved in data processing activities.

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, with legal basis being the user's agreement to processing their personal data as per the consent management system provided. However, it is not clear if legitimate interest is also a basis for processing, which may be an issue under GDPR.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can change their privacy settings or withdraw their consent at any time by clicking on the Privacy Button.
     - Granular Consent: Yes, users are given the option to adjust their privacy settings based on specific purposes and/or at a vendor level.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, users are informed about the purpose of data processing, the vendors involved, and their rights to object or withdraw consent. However, more detailed information could be provided about the types of personal data being processed and how it is used.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, with clarity level being moderate. The policy mentions that 51 third-party vendors are involved in data processing, but does not specify the exact nature of their involvement or how they may use the data.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Compliant, as the policy defines consent as any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, either by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant, as the policy provides information about the processing purposes, the identity of the controller and the recipients of the personal data, and gives users the right to withdraw their consent at any time. However, clarity could be improved regarding the legal basis for processing and the consequences of not providing consent.

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR because it provides a means for users to give and withdraw consent for data processing, but does not sufficiently clarify the legal basis for processing, the types of personal data being processed, or the implications of refusing consent.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly state the legal bases for processing personal data (consent and/or legitimate interest).
   - Provide more detailed information about the types of personal data being processed, how it is used, and the potential consequences of not providing consent.
   - Make it clear that users can refuse to provide consent without detriment, and explain what services or functionalities may be affected by their decision.
   - Clearly state the retention period for collected data and any mechanisms in place to ensure its security.
   - Provide a comprehensive list of all vendors involved in data processing, along with information about their privacy practices and opt-out options."

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user is asked for explicit consent via the ""Accept All"" button for performance and marketing cookies. However, this consent does not seem to meet the granularity requirements as it is not possible to accept or reject specific categories of cookies individually. (Legal Basis: Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can withdraw their consent at any time by changing cookie settings. However, further processing of data already collected before revoking consent cannot be ruled out.
     - Granular Consent: No, as there is no option to accept or reject specific categories of cookies individually.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides detailed information about the types of cookies used, their purposes, and third-party providers involved in data processing. However, it lacks clear explanation about the legal basis for each category of cookie (e.g., performance vs marketing).
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, with clear indication that personal data may be transferred to third countries outside the EU, but no specific information is provided on how these third parties process data.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the consent mechanism does not meet the GDPR requirement of being 'freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous'. The lack of granularity means that users are forced to accept all cookies or none.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as users are provided with information about the processing and can give their consent, but not in a manner that allows them to give specific, informed, and unambiguous consent to each category of cookie.

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it provides transparency regarding the use of cookies and data processing but lacks granularity in the consent mechanism, which does not meet GDPR requirements for explicit and informed consent.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Introduce a system that allows users to give individual consent or rejection for each category of cookie (functional, performance, marketing).
   - Provide clear information about the legal basis for each category of cookie (e.g., Art. 6(1)(a), Art. 6(1)(f), etc.).
   - Clarify that users can revoke their consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
   - Specify how third parties process data and provide clear, concise information about each third-party provider involved in data processing."

     - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user is asked to give consent before cookies are stored on their device. However, there is no separate consent for each type of cookie (granular consent), and the user cannot easily access the specific purposes for which data is being processed (data transparency). The legal basis for processing is not specified.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, the user can manage their consent preferences at any time by going to the ""Cookies Settings"" section.
     - Granular Consent: No, as the user cannot give separate consent for different types of cookies (performance, functional, targeting).
     - Data Transparency: Partially Compliant, as the user is informed about the use of cookies but lacks clarity on the specific purposes and legal basis for each type of cookie.
  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the policy does not provide a clear explanation of what is understood by ""consent"" in accordance with GDPR definitions.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as while explicit consent is obtained, the user is not provided with a clear and concise description of the processing activities for which they are giving consent.
  4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it obtains user consent but lacks transparency regarding the purposes of data processing and the legal basis for such processing. This can be problematic under GDPR regulations, as explicit, granular, and informed consent are essential elements.
  5. Suggested Enhancements:
    1. Clearly define what is meant by ""consent"" in accordance with Article 4(11) of the GDPR.
    2. Provide a separate consent option for each type of cookie (performance, functional, targeting).
    3. Specify the legal basis for processing and offer a clear description of the purposes of data processing to users.

     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, the user can withdraw their consent at any time by changing cookie settings in the ""Cookie Settings"" section.
     - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, as the user is given the option to accept or reject all cookies but not individual cookies (e.g., Google Analytics).
     - Data Transparency: Yes, some information about data processing and its scope is provided in the cookie policy. However, details regarding third-party data handling could be more explicit.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, the use of third-party services such as Google Analytics and YouTube Video is clearly mentioned, but the level of clarity could be improved by explicitly stating that these services may collect and process user data outside the EU.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the policy does not provide a clear explanation of what constitutes consent under GDPR and how it is obtained. Consent should be ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous.""
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant, as the user is provided with the option to give or withdraw their consent, but there is a lack of granularity in the consent options.

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it provides some transparency about data processing and offers a mechanism to withdraw consent. However, it fails to meet GDPR requirements for explicit and granular consent. The primary reason behind this classification is the lack of specificity regarding user consent for certain cookies (e.g., Google Analytics).

5. Suggested Enhancements:

     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can change or revoke their consent at any time through the Privacy Preference Center.
     - Granular Consent: Yes, users are given an opportunity to select specific categories of cookies they wish to accept (Necessary, Performance, Marketing).
     - Data Transparency: Yes, some information about the purpose and categories of cookies is provided, but more clarity could be added for certain third-party services.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but the level of clarity is insufficient as the text does not explicitly mention that data may be transferred to countries outside the EU without an adequate level of data protection (Article 49 GDPR).

  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Compliant, the policy defines consent as any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the user's wishes.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, the policy fails to provide a clear, concise, and easily accessible form to request consent that can be separated from other matters, such as terms of service (Article 7(2) GDPR). The legal basis for marketing activities is also not explicitly stated.

  4. Final Justification: The Cookie Policy is partially compliant with GDPR because it provides users with the opportunity to provide explicit consent and withdraw that consent at any time, but it lacks clarity regarding certain aspects such as the legal basis for processing and third-party data handling outside of the EU.

   - Explicit Consent: Yes, but the policy does not specify the legal basis for processing the data (Article 6 of GDPR). It only mentions improving user experience and analytics purposes.
   - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can adjust their cookie preferences at any time. However, it's unclear if changing preferences will halt previously gathered data or simply prevent future data collection.
   - Granular Consent: Yes, but the policy could be more granular by providing separate options for each type of cookie (e.g., essential, analytics, performance, external content) rather than just two options (accept all/essential only).
   - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy explains the purpose of cookies in a general sense, but it does not provide specific information about the categories of personal data processed or retained.
   - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but there is no clarity on whether third parties have their own cookie policies and how they handle user data.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant. The definition provided does not align fully with the GDPR definition of consent, as it doesn't clearly state that users have a genuine choice and can refuse or withdraw their consent without detriment.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant. While users are given a choice to accept or reject cookies, there is no transparency regarding the identity of the data controller(s) and processor(s), nor is there information about the period for which the personal data will be stored.

4. Final Justification: The policy does not fully comply with GDPR requirements as it lacks sufficient transparency in the definition of consent, and it could benefit from improvements in granularity of consent options and providing clearer information about data retention and third-party handling.

     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, the user can change their cookie settings at any time according to their wishes. However, it could be improved by providing an easy-to-find option for revoking consent and clear information about how this will affect their experience on the site.
     - Granular Consent: Partially compliant, as users can choose between accepting all cookies or specific categories. However, more granular options should be provided to ensure that users understand exactly which cookies they are consenting to.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, detailed information on the cookies, their purposes, third-party recipients, cookie lifespan, etc., can be found in the Cookie Privacy Policy and General Privacy Policy.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but there is no clarity about the specific third parties involved and how they use the data collected through cookies.

3. Compliance with Articles:

     - Explicit Consent: Yes, consent is required to use cookies and technologies (Article 5(3) GDPR), but it may not be specific and granular enough as users have the option to choose between ""Allow All"" or ""Only Allow Necessary"", which does not provide separate consent for each purpose. The legal basis for processing can be found in Article 6(1)(a) (consent) and Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests) GDPR, as the website relies on both user consent and legitimate interest of partners to process personal data.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can revoke their consent at any time via the Privacy Settings at the bottom of the website.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the consent mechanism does not meet the GDPR definition of consent, which requires clear, affirmative action and separate options for each purpose and provider.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant, as users are provided with a choice to accept or decline cookies but could be improved by offering more granular control over their data.

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it provides users with the option to give consent for the use of cookies and technologies, along with a withdrawal mechanism. However, it does not meet the GDPR requirement for clear, affirmative action and separate options for each purpose or provider, making the consent non-specific and potentially invalid.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Offer users granular control over their data by providing separate options for each purpose (e.g., website reliability, statistical analysis, content personalization) and provider.
   - Clearly explain what personal data is being processed, the legal basis for processing, and how long the data will be stored.

   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Non-Compliant, as Article 7 requires that consent is ""prior"" to any processing activity. In this case, users have already started browsing the site before being presented with the cookie policy, which could be seen as after the processing has begun.

4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements due to the provision of a withdrawal mechanism and granular consent options. However, it fails to meet the requirement of obtaining prior consent by presenting the cookie policy after the user has started browsing the site.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - To meet legal requirements, it is recommended to present the cookie policy before any processing activity begins to ensure that users provide prior consent as required by Article 7.

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, but the policy does not specify a legal basis for processing cookies beyond website functionality (necessary cookies).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can revoke their consent at any time by accessing the Privacy Settings at the bottom of the website.
     - Granular Consent: Yes, users can customize preferences for each category of cookie.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides a list of cookies and their purposes, as well as data processing providers and services. However, it does not clearly state how long the data will be stored or processed.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but clarity is lacking on whether users are informed about the potential transfer of their personal data to countries outside the EU and whether adequate safeguards are in place.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant. The policy does not explicitly state that consent is ""specific, informed and unambiguous"". Consent appears to be given by allowing all cookies, rather than by a clear affirmative action for each category of cookie.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant, but with room for improvement. While the policy provides an option to customize cookie preferences, it could be more user-friendly and provide a clearer explanation of the consequences of each option.

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it allows users to manage their cookie preferences, although not in a very user-friendly way. However, it does not meet the GDPR standard for explicit consent as it does not require a clear affirmative action for each category of cookie.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly state that giving consent to cookies is based on Article 6(1)(a) (Consent) or another applicable legal basis for processing under the GDPR.
   - Simplify the user interface for managing cookie preferences and provide clear explanations of the consequences of each option.
   - Inform users about potential data transfers to third countries, and ensure adequate safeguards are in place (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield certification).
   - Clearly explain how long cookies will be stored or processed for."

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, but it is only obtained for technical and functional cookies, not all types (e.g., marketing, performance, audience measurement). The basis for consent for these other categories is unclear.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can withdraw their consent at any time through the settings. However, there is no easy way to revoke consent once it has been given for all cookies.
     - Granular Consent: Partially compliant, as users are only asked to accept or decline all cookies without being able to make granular choices.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, some information about the purposes of data processing and vendors is provided in the settings, but more detailed information (e.g., purpose of each specific cookie, retention periods) could be beneficial for transparency.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but the level of clarity is low as users are only informed that data may be transferred to third countries without an adequate level of protection and subjected to potential access by authorities without legal remedy.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the definition of consent does not meet GDPR requirements as it is not specific, informed, and freely given. The user does not have a genuine choice in accepting all cookies or refusing them entirely.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Non-Compliant, as the information provided to users does not allow them to make an informed decision about their consent and they are not offered a granular choice regarding which types of cookies they accept.

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR because it provides some transparency into data processing activities but falls short in obtaining valid consent for all categories of cookies and offering users the ability to make informed, granular choices about their preferences.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Offer a clear, granular choice to users regarding which types of cookies they accept (technical, functional, performance, audience measurement, marketing).
   - Provide more detailed information about each specific cookie's purpose, retention periods, and third-party vendors involved.
   - Simplify the withdrawal mechanism for consent by allowing users to revoke consent for individual categories of cookies easily.
   - Clearly define and inform users about the legal basis for processing their personal data for each category of cookies.
   - Clarify that user consent can be withdrawn at any time without future effect.
   - Ensure transparency regarding third-party data handling by providing information about the adequate level of protection in data transfer to third countries and available legal remedies."

     - Explicit Consent: No, the policy does not provide a clear and granular method for obtaining explicit consent for the use of non-essential cookies.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can adjust their cookie settings, but this is not presented as an ongoing mechanism to withdraw consent.
     - Granular Consent: No, the policy does not provide a granular option to accept or refuse specific categories of cookies.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy explains the types of cookies used and their purposes, but it lacks clarity on third-party data handling.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Partially Compliant, some third-party services are listed, but there is no clear information about how their data is shared, processed, or stored.

   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, the policy does not clearly define that consent is ""any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which they, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signify agreement to the processing of personal data relating to them.""
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Non-Compliant, the policy does not provide a way for users to give and withdraw consent in a granular manner. The use of non-essential cookies is not optional, and users cannot refuse or revoke their consent once given.

4. Final Justification: The cookie policy does not comply with GDPR requirements regarding explicit, informed, and freely given consent, as it lacks granularity in the consent process and does not allow users to opt-out of non-essential cookies.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly define consent in accordance with Article 4(11) guidelines.
   - Provide a granular method for obtaining explicit consent, allowing users to accept or refuse specific categories of cookies.
   - Implement an ongoing withdrawal mechanism that allows users to revoke their consent easily and at any time.

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, but the granularity of consent is not explicitly clear as users are asked to accept all processing or only functional cookies without a clear explanation of what each category entails. The legal basis for data processing could be justified under Article 6(1)(a) (consent) and Article 6(1)(f) (legitimate interests).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can manage their preferences at any time through the ""Cookie Settings.""
     - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, as the policy does not provide sufficient information about what each category of cookies does.
     - Data Transparency: Partially Compliant, as further details are available in the Privacy Policy but not directly within the cookie policy itself.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, with clarity level Moderate. The policy lists data processing providers and services, but it is not clear whether these third parties are acting as controllers or processors, and if they are processors, whether appropriate data processor agreements are in place.

   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant. The policy does not explicitly state that the given consent is ""freely given,"" ""specific,"" ""informed,"" and ""unambiguous.""
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as the conditions for consent are not clearly communicated to users in a concise, easily accessible format.

4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements because it provides an option to manage cookie preferences and offers a withdrawal mechanism. However, it falls short in ensuring the free, specific, informed, and unambiguous nature of consent as required by Article 7.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly define each category of cookies and explain their purpose (granularity).
   - Provide concise information about the legal basis for data processing within the cookie policy itself, in addition to the Privacy Policy.
   - Explicitly state that consent is given freely, specifically, and unambiguously, and provide an easy-to-understand explanation of what constitutes withdrawal of consent.
   - If third parties are acting as controllers or processors, ensure appropriate data processor agreements are in place.

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, users are given the option to accept or reject cookies and are informed about the data processing in the USA. However, the consent mechanism could be improved for granularity (see below).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can access their cookie settings at any time via the Cookie Policy and revoke their consent.
     - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, as users can select non-essential cookies but not individually, only by group (Performance, Functional, Targeting).
     - Data Transparency: Yes, users are informed about the purpose of each type of cookie and provided with a link to the Privacy Policy for more details.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, it is mentioned that data may be processed in the USA, but the level of clarity could be improved (see below).

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Compliant, as the policy refers to the definition of consent as ""any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her"".
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as the consent is specific and informed but could be more granular. Also, it's unclear whether the use of cookies strictly necessary for the provision of a service is based on a legitimate interest rather than explicit consent.

4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements due to the absence of a granular mechanism for users to provide explicit consent for different types of cookies and some ambiguity regarding the legal basis for processing strictly necessary cookies.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Improve granularity by allowing users to individually select which non-essential cookies they accept.
   - Clearly state the legal basis for processing strictly necessary cookies (e.g., legitimate interest).
   - Provide more details about third-party data handling in the USA, such as the specific parties involved and any measures taken to ensure adequate protection of personal data.
   - Consider using clearer and less technical language throughout the policy to make it easier for users to understand their options."

     - Explicit Consent: Yes, users have the option to accept or reject cookies and can also manage their preferences. The legal basis for processing is consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can withdraw their consent at any time by changing their cookie settings.
     - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, as while users can manage their preferences, not all cookies are clearly distinguished between functional and advertising cookies, making it difficult for users to make informed decisions.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides information about the purpose of using cookies and allows users to manage their preferences.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but clarity level is unclear as the policy does not specify whether third-parties have access to advertising cookies or not.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Partially Compliant, as while users are given the opportunity to consent or withdraw their consent, it is not explicitly stated that giving or withholding consent will not affect the functioning of the website or the provision of a service.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as users are informed about the processing of personal data and given the ability to withdraw their consent, but the information provided is not always concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible.

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, users are presented with three options to choose from, which is a form of consent. However, the consent for analytics and marketing purposes could be improved as it requires explicit affirmative action (clicking ""Accept All"") instead of passive inaction (""Settings"" option). Legal Basis: Legitimate Interest (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR), Consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users are allowed to change their preferences at any time by clicking on the ""Settings"" option.
     - Granular Consent: Partially compliant, as users can choose between three options but need to click ""Accept All"" for marketing purposes. This could be improved by providing separate, granular consent for analytics and marketing.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, users are informed about the use of cookies and similar technologies, the purpose of data processing, and the possibility of changing their preferences.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but clarity could be improved by specifying who these third parties are (e.g., partner list) and ensuring that they comply with GDPR requirements.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Compliant, as the policy defines consent in accordance with the GDPR definition.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially compliant, as explicit and informed consent is obtained but could be improved by providing granular consent options and making it easier for users to withdraw their consent.

4. Final Justification: The policy partially meets GDPR requirements by obtaining user consent for the use of cookies. However, the lack of granular consent options and clear information about third-party data handling raises concerns about the quality and validity of that consent.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Provide separate, granular consent options for analytics and marketing purposes to ensure users fully understand what they are agreeing to.
   - Improve clarity regarding third-party data handling by explicitly listing partners and ensuring they also comply with GDPR requirements.
   - Make it easier for users to withdraw their consent, for example, by offering an ""Opt Out"" option in addition to the current ""Settings"" option.
   - Consider providing more detailed information about the purpose of each cookie and the data processing activities it enables."

     - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user is given a choice to accept or decline cookies and tracking. The ""One-Click Opt-In"" option grants full consent to all cookies and tracking, but it may not be clear if this includes third-party cookies.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can revoke their consent at any time by adjusting settings within the cookie settings menu.

While users are given choices, it may not be clear to them what they are consenting to when choosing the ""One-Click Opt-In"" option.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant, as users are provided with clear and concise information about the processing of their personal data and have the choice to accept or decline cookies and tracking. However, the policy could benefit from more specificity regarding third-party data handling.

4. Final Justification: The cookie policy partially complies with GDPR requirements because it provides users with choices and a mechanism to withdraw consent. However, it falls short in terms of providing clear and specific information about the types of data being processed, especially when it comes to third-party data handling.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Compliant. The policy uses clear and affirmative actions to seek consent from the user before setting non-essential cookies.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant. While the policy does provide information about cookie purposes, it could be more transparent regarding the specific third-party processors involved in data processing.

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR because it seeks user consent for non-essential cookies and provides a mechanism to withdraw that consent.

     - Explicit Consent: Yes, but the consent is not granular as users cannot selectively accept or reject specific types of cookies (e.g., advertising cookies). The legal basis for processing personal data is legitimate interests (improving shopping experience and providing services).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, the policy directs users to the Privacy Policy and Cookie Notice for more information on how to manage their cookie settings. However, this mechanism does not appear to allow for easy and immediate withdrawal of consent.
     - Granular Consent: No, as users cannot selectively accept or reject specific types of cookies.

     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, with the Amazon Services and third parties (such as demographic information) collecting and processing personal data. Clarity Level: Moderate, as it provides some details but could be more specific.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the consent mechanism does not meet the GDPR's requirement for clear and affirmative action to opt in.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Non-Compliant, as the conditions for consent are not met because the user cannot give specific, informed, and unambiguous consent to the processing of personal data.

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user is asked for consent before any cookies are set, and there are options to either accept all cookies or manage preferences. However, the basis of the legal justification is not explicitly mentioned in the policy.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can withdraw their consent by managing their privacy settings under ""Tracking"" in the website footer.
     - Granular Consent: Yes, users are given an option to manage cookie preferences on a per-category basis (Essential, Functional, Marketing & Advertising, Advanced Features).
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides information about the types of cookies used, their purposes, and potential data sharing with third parties.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but there is no clarity on whether users are informed about each specific third party involved in data processing.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the policy does not provide a clear description of what constitutes consent under GDPR (e.g., freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes).
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant, as users are provided with clear information about the processing activities, their right to withdraw consent, and the existence of the right to object. However, it is not explicitly stated whether the provision of consent is a requirement necessary for the performance of a contract.

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it provides an option for users to manage their cookie preferences and withdraw their consent, but lacks clarity on the legal basis for data processing and does not specify each third party involved in data processing, which are crucial aspects under the GDPR.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly state the legal basis for data processing (e.g., contract performance, legitimate interests).
   - Provide a list of all third parties involved in data processing and their respective purposes.
   - Explicitly mention that the provision of consent is a requirement necessary for the performance of a contract or in order to use the website's services.
   - Ensure transparency by providing detailed information about each category of cookies used (e.g., specific purposes, data retention periods, and any potential third-party sharing)."

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, user consent is required for marketing and analytics purposes (Legal Basis: Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can revoke their consent at any time in the Cookie Manager (Manage my preferences).
     - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, while users are informed about different categories of cookies (required, analytics & personalization, marketing), granular consent is not obtained for each specific cookie or purpose.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy informs users about the purposes and types of cookies used, but further information could be provided to improve transparency.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, data may be shared with third parties for marketing purposes (clarity level: good).

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Compliant, the policy defines consent as ""any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.""
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, while the policy informs users about their rights and provides a withdrawal mechanism, granular consent is not obtained for each specific purpose or cookie.

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR because it obtains user consent and offers a withdrawal mechanism, but lacks granularity in obtaining consent for different purposes and cookies. This may pose an issue when assessing the validity of user consent under Article 7.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Obtain granular consent by providing users with detailed information about each specific cookie or purpose, allowing them to accept or reject these individually.
   - Increase transparency by including more detailed explanations about the purposes of cookies and data sharing practices with third parties.

     - Explicit Consent: Yes, but not specific enough as the types of personal data being collected and third-party cookies are not clearly stated. Legal Basis: Legitimate Interest (Article 6(1)(f)) for Strictly Necessary Cookies and Performance Cookies, and Consent (Article 6(1)(a)) for Functional Cookies, Social Media Cookies, and Personalization cookies.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can change their preferences at any time. Legal Justification: Article 7(3) GDPR.
     - Granular Consent: Yes, but improvement is needed to provide more detailed information about each type of cookie (e.g., purpose, data retention period, and third-party involved).
     - Data Transparency: Yes, users are informed about the types of cookies used and their purposes. However, more specific information should be provided about third-party cookies and personal data collected.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but clarity level is poor as there is no explicit mention of the third parties involved in cookie handling.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant. The policy does not provide a clear, affirmative action by which the user indicates and signifies their consent to the processing of personal data.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant. Users are provided with clear and concise information about the types of cookies, their purposes, and the ability to withdraw their consent at any time. However, more detailed information should be provided about third-party cookies and personal data collected.

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant as it provides users with an option to manage their cookie preferences. However, it falls short of the GDPR requirements in terms of providing clear, granular consent, specific information about personal data and third-party cookies, and ensuring transparency in data handling.

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user is presented with a clear choice to accept or reject cookies. The legal basis for processing these cookies would be consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can withdraw their consent at any time by changing their cookie preferences.
     - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, the policy does not provide specific details on each type of cookie and its purpose. However, it allows users to select or deselect individual categories of cookies.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides some information about each cookie, including its name, lifespan, provider, and purpose.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, the policy mentions third-party cookies from etracker.com and Cloudflare. However, it does not clearly specify whether these third parties have access to personally identifiable information.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Compliant, the policy defines consent as the freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which they, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signify agreement to the processing of personal data relating to them.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, while users are provided with information about the cookies and given the opportunity to give or withdraw their consent, there is insufficient transparency regarding the purpose of each cookie.

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it provides some level of transparency, allows users to manage their cookie preferences, and offers a withdrawal mechanism. However, it falls short in providing sufficient information about the purpose of each cookie, which is crucial for informed consent under GDPR.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly label each category of cookies (necessary, statistics) and provide detailed descriptions for each individual cookie, explaining their specific purposes.
   - Specify whether third-party providers have access to personally identifiable information or not. If they do, a data processing agreement should be in place with these parties.
   - Consider using a cookie consent management platform that allows users to manage their preferences more granularly and provides more detailed information about each cookie."
legal_analysis,non_compliant,non_compliant-26.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Legal Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, but the user is given only two options (Accept all/Reject all) which may not provide a clear understanding of what each option entails and what data is being collected. The legal basis for processing cookies should be explicitly stated.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can change their cookie settings at any time. However, the information provided about the consequences of rejecting all cookies could be clearer.
     - Granular Consent: Partially, as users are allowed to manage consent preferences, but the level of granularity could be improved. For example, users should have the option to accept/reject individual types of cookies instead of just accepting/rejecting all.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, some information is provided about the use of cookies and their purposes, but it could be more detailed and easy to understand.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but the level of clarity is unclear as it's not explicitly stated whether third-party cookies are used for marketing purposes or not.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the definition provided in the policy does not fully align with the GDPR's definition of consent. Consent under GDPR must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant, as users are given the option to give or withdraw their consent. However, the level of granularity could be improved to ensure that each processing activity is based on a separate consent.

4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR as it allows users to manage their cookie preferences and provides some information about cookies. However, it does not meet all requirements of the GDPR, particularly in terms of providing clear, concise, and detailed information about what data is being collected, why it's being collected, and the consequences of rejecting all cookies.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly state the legal basis for processing cookies (e.g., legitimate interests, contractual necessity, etc.).
   - Provide a clear explanation of what each cookie category entails, including whether third-party cookies are used for marketing purposes or not.
   - Offer users more granular control over their cookie preferences, allowing them to accept/reject individual types of cookies instead of just accepting/rejecting all.
   - Improve the clarity and comprehensibility of the information provided about cookies and their purposes, ensuring that it is easy for users to understand what they are consenting to.
   - Provide a clear explanation of the consequences of rejecting all cookies, including any impact this may have on the functionality of the website and the user's experience with the services provided."
legal_analysis,non_compliant,non_compliant-28.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Legal Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, but the user is only asked for global consent for all cookies, which may not be granular enough to meet GDPR requirements as users should have the option to give or withdraw consent for each category of cookie (Article 7(4)). The legal basis is legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR), but it could be argued that consent would be a more appropriate legal basis given the nature of the data processing.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can revoke their consent at any time. However, it's not immediately clear how they can do this within the cookie policy itself. A link to the privacy policy where this option is described might be more user-friendly.
     - Granular Consent: No, as mentioned above, the user is only given the option to accept all cookies or deny them all, without being able to select which specific categories they consent to.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, some information about the types of cookies used and their purposes is provided, but more detailed information could be added to improve transparency (e.g., retention periods, third-party data handling practices).
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but the clarity level is low as there's no clear indication of which third parties collect personal data or where this data might be transferred to.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant. The policy does not explicitly state that the given consent is ""specific, informed and unambiguous"". The wording suggests a global consent rather than individual consent for each category of cookie.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant. While users are asked for their consent, it's not granular enough to meet the requirements of Article 7(4). Additionally, the legal basis might be incorrect as explicit consent would be more appropriate given the nature of the data processing.

4. Final Justification: The policy does not comply fully with GDPR due to its lack of granularity in obtaining user consent for cookies and potential issues with the chosen legal basis.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly define the different categories of cookies and provide users with an option to give or withdraw consent for each category.
   - Improve transparency by providing more detailed information about data retention periods, third-party data handling practices, etc.
   - Clarify the legal basis for data processing and consider using explicit consent where appropriate.
   - Make it easier for users to revoke their consent within the cookie policy itself or at least provide a clear link to where they can do so.
   - Be more specific about third-party data handling, including which third parties collect personal data and where this data might be transferred to."

   - Data Transparency: Yes, users are provided with information about the purpose of cookies and can find further details in the Privacy Statement.
   - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, the use of various third-party services is disclosed but clarity on the specific data processing activities by these third parties is lacking.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, the definition of consent provided does not clearly distinguish between the separate types of cookies or processing operations, as required under GDPR.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, while users are informed and given the option to revoke their consent, granularity could be improved by allowing individual selection of third-party services.

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it provides users with an option to give or revoke their consent for cookies but lacks clarity in its definition of consent and does not offer granular control over third-party data processing activities.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly define the types of cookies and processing operations within the policy, meeting the requirements of Article 4(11) GDPR.
   - Offer granular control to users over individual third-party services, ensuring compliance with Article 7 GDPR.

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, the policy requests users to explicitly agree to the use of cookies. The legal basis is Contract (Article 6(1)(b)) for necessary cookies and Consent (Article 6(1)(a)) for non-essential cookies.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can withdraw their consent at any time by adjusting their settings in the policy or opting out of specific types of processing.
     - Granular Consent: Partially compliant. While users can choose between three options (Agree, Decline, Adjust), granularity could be improved by offering more specific choices regarding individual third-party partners and data processing methods.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides sufficient information about the purposes of data processing, the types of cookies used, and the identity of involved third parties.
  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Compliant. The definition of consent is consistent with the GDPR requirements.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially compliant. While users are informed about the purposes of data processing, granularity could be improved as discussed in point 2.3.
  4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it provides explicit consent and a withdrawal mechanism but does not offer sufficient granularity for users to fully understand and control their personal data processing options. This could lead to confusion about the specific purposes of data processing, particularly when it comes to third-party partners involved.
  5. Suggested Enhancements: To meet legal requirements more effectively, the cookie policy should offer more granular consent options, allowing users to choose which specific third-party partners and data processing methods they agree to have their personal data processed for. Additionally, improving the clarity of language in the policy may help ensure that users fully understand their rights under GDPR."

     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can withdraw their consent at any time in the ""Cookie Settings"". However, it's not clear how this affects any data already collected before the withdrawal of consent.
     - Granular Consent: Partially compliant, as the policy allows for the acceptance of all cookies with a single click, but individual categories can be managed within the ""Cookie Settings"".
     - Data Transparency: Yes, users are informed about the use and purpose of cookies, and they are provided with the option to manage their consent. However, more detailed information about the specific third-party services used could be beneficial for transparency.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but clarity level is low as the list of services only provides their categories without explicit naming or linking to external privacy policies.

  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the policy does not clearly state that consent is ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous"", which is a requirement under GDPR for valid consent.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as users are provided with the option to manage their consent, but explicit and informed consent may not be obtained due to the initial acceptance of all cookies with a single click.

  4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it provides some level of transparency regarding the use of cookies and allows users to manage their consent. However, it does not meet all the requirements for explicit and informed consent under GDPR.

     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can change their settings at any time via the cookie button. However, there is no clear explanation of what happens to previously collected data when consent is withdrawn.
     - Granular Consent: Yes, users can individually select which cookies/functions are activated under categories/services.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, some information is provided about the purposes for which data is processed and the use of third-party services like Google Analytics, Microsoft Clarity, and YouTube. However, more detailed information about the specific data processing activities carried out by these third parties would be beneficial.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but the policy could be clearer about how data is shared with third parties outside of the EU.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Non-Compliant]: The definition provided for consent is not in line with GDPR requirements, as it fails to provide a straightforward explanation of the meaning and scope of consent in the context of this policy.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant]: While users are given the opportunity to give or withdraw their consent, the information provided about the processing activities and third-party services is not always comprehensive enough for users to make an informed decision.

However, the policy lacks clarity on the legal basis for processing (e.g., legitimate interest).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes (The user can withdraw consent at any time via a link provided in the policy.)
     - Granular Consent: Partially (While users can manage their preferences, there is no distinction between essential and non-essential cookies, which may not be compliant with GDPR requirements for granularity.)
     - Data Transparency: Yes (The policy provides some information about the purpose of each category of cookie and the potential third-party involvement.)
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes (+ Clarity Level: The policy acknowledges that consenting to functional cookies may result in data transfer outside the EEA, and that this could impact users' rights and potentially expose their data to state authorities.)

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Compliant (+ Reason: The policy explicitly requests consent for the use of cookies and provides a means for users to withdraw this consent, meeting the definition of consent under GDPR.)
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Non-Compliant (+ Reason: While explicit consent is given, there is no clear information about the purpose, legal basis, or potential consequences of refusing cookies. This lack of transparency may not satisfy the ""informed"" and ""specific"" requirements for valid consent under GDPR.)

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR because it provides a means for users to give and withdraw their consent for the use of cookies, but does not sufficiently inform them about the purposes, legal basis, or consequences of such consent. This lack of transparency may render the consent invalid under Article 7 of GDPR.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly outline the legal basis for processing cookies (e.g., legitimate interest) and explain the potential consequences of refusing cookies, particularly in terms of site functionality.
   - Provide more granular control over different types of cookies, ensuring users can easily distinguish between essential and non-essential cookies.
   - Increase transparency by explaining the purpose(s) of each category of cookie, as well as any potential third-party involvement or data transfer outside the EEA. This information should be presented in a clear and concise manner to facilitate informed consent under GDPR."

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the consent language does not clearly specify that the user is providing a specific, informed and unambiguous indication of their wishes by which they, by statement or clear affirmative action, signify agreement to the processing of personal data.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant, as the user's consent is required for non-essential cookies, but clarity could be improved regarding the specific purposes for which the data will be processed.

Final Justification: The cookie policy is partially compliant with GDPR requirements because it allows users to withdraw their consent and provides some information about what cookies are and their general purpose. However, it does not meet GDPR standards for granularity in the consent request and transparency regarding the specific purposes for which each category of cookies is used.

  5. Suggested Enhancements: To meet GDPR requirements, the cookie policy should be revised to include explicit information about the specific purposes for which each category of cookies is used (e.g., analytics, functionality, marketing), as well as clear and specific language regarding the legal basis for consent. Additionally, users should be provided with more granular control over their cookie preferences, and the impact of withdrawing consent on website functionality should be clarified. Transparency regarding third-party data handling is also important to ensure compliance with GDPR requirements."

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: No, there is no explicit request for users to opt-in before non-essential cookies are set (Article 7(1)). The legal basis for processing these cookies should be outlined (e.g., legitimate interest).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can save and close their selection or choose to show more information about the cookies. However, it's not clear if this withdrawal of consent is persistent or if cookies are re-set after a user leaves the site.
     - Granular Consent: No, users are not presented with an option to select individual types of non-essential cookies. They can only accept all or show more information.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, some information is provided about the purpose of each cookie category (e.g., essential and statistics). However, detailed information on specific cookies used should be disclosed for full transparency.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: No clarity, as no information is provided about any third-party data handling or processing.
  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as explicit consent was not obtained prior to setting non-essential cookies, which goes against the GDPR definition of consent (Article 4(11)).
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Non-Compliant, as the conditions are not met due to the lack of granularity and explicit request for consent.
  4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it provides some transparency about the use of cookies but fails to meet the GDPR requirements for explicit consent and granular control over non-essential cookies.
  5. Suggested Enhancements:
    - Clearly request users' consent before setting non-essential cookies, explaining the legal basis (e.g., legitimate interest).
    - Offer a granular control mechanism that allows users to select specific types of non-essential cookies they agree to.
    - Provide detailed information about each cookie used, including its purpose, data retention period, and any third-party data handling or processing.
    - Implement a persistent withdrawal mechanism so that user choices are remembered across visits."

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, but it is not granular as users cannot selectively accept or reject different types of cookies (e.g., performance-related, functional, social media and marketing). The legal basis for data processing is the user's consent, which should be specific, informed, and freely given (Article 7(4)).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can manage their cookie preferences at any time. However, it would be more compliant if this option was explicitly presented when first visiting the website.
     - Granular Consent: No, as previously mentioned, users cannot selectively accept or reject different types of cookies.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, some information about the purpose of cookie usage and data transfer outside the EEA is provided. However, more specific details about each type of cookie used should be disclosed (Article 13).
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but clarity could be improved by explicitly stating which third parties have access to user data and for what purposes.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the policy does not clearly state that consent is ""any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.""
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as users can withdraw their consent and are provided with some information about the purpose of data processing. However, the policy does not meet all the requirements outlined in Article 7(3) and (4), such as ensuring that consent is specific, informed, and granular.

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it allows users to manage their cookie preferences, provides some information about data processing purposes, and offers a withdrawal mechanism. However, it fails to meet GDPR requirements regarding explicit, granular consent, full transparency, and specific third-party data handling disclosures.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Provide granular consent options for different types of cookies (e.g., performance-related, functional, social media, and marketing).
   - Clearly state the purpose of each type of cookie used in the policy.
   - Improve transparency by explicitly disclosing which third parties have access to user data and for what purposes.
   - Revise the consent language to ensure it meets the GDPR's definition of explicit, specific, informed, and unambiguous consent (Article 4(11))."

     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can revoke their consent ""with effect for the future.""
     - Granular Consent: No, as it does not provide separate options for different categories of cookies.
     - Data Transparency: Partially Compliant, as it mentions the purposes (analysis, performance, marketing, individual marketing) but lacks details about the data being collected and third-party providers involved.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, with a level of Clarity: Low, as it does not specify which third parties are involved in handling the data.

  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the policy does not provide a clear and affirmative action (opt-in consent).
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as it fulfills some conditions but lacks specificity regarding the purpose of processing and third parties involved.

  4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR because it allows users to revoke their consent, but it fails to meet the requirements for explicit, granular, and fully transparent consent due to a lack of clear information about the data being collected, purposes, and third-party providers involved.

  5. Suggested Enhancements:
     - Specify the legal basis (e.g., consent or legitimate interest) for using cookies.
     - Provide granular options for users to choose which types of cookies they accept.

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user is given three options (Set preferences, Only essential, and Accept all), allowing them to accept or reject cookies based on their preference. The basis for this consent is legitimate interests as it's necessary for providing a personalized shopping experience. However, the GDPR requires that at least one legal basis for processing must be based on the data subject's consent (Article 6(1)(a)).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, the user can adjust their preferences at any time.
     - Granular Consent: Partially, as users are given the option to accept or reject all cookies but not to select specific categories of cookies they want to allow/reject.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides information about the types of cookies used and why they are collected. However, it could be improved by providing clearer explanations about how user data will be processed in the USA and China.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, the policy states that data may be shared with third parties like Facebook and Google for targeted advertising purposes. The level of clarity is good as it informs users that their data may be used for this purpose.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, the policy does not explicitly state that consent must be ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous"" as required by GDPR.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, while users are given the option to accept or reject cookies, they are not clearly informed about the purpose of processing their data or provided with a clear and separate opt-in for each category of cookies.

4. Final Justification: The cookie policy partially complies with GDPR as it provides some information about data collection and offers users options to adjust their preferences. However, it does not meet all GDPR requirements such as providing explicit consent for each category of cookies and ensuring that the basis for processing is based on user's consent.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Explicitly state that consent must be ""freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous"" in accordance with GDPR Article 4(11).
   - Offer users the ability to select which categories of cookies they want to allow/reject (granular consent) rather than only offering three options (Accept all, Only essential, and Set preferences).
   - Clearly explain the purpose of processing user data in the USA and China.

     - Granular Consent: Yes, users can individually give or withdraw consent for specific purposes and functions.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, users are provided with information about the purpose, legal basis, storage duration, and their right to revoke consent at any time.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, with Clarity Level: The cookie policy mentions partners (including Utiq) involved in data processing and provides a link to further information. However, it could be more explicit about the specific third parties that handle personal data.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant] The cookie policy defines consent as ""any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.""
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] The policy provides information about the purposes and types of processing. However, it could be more explicit about how the consent is specific, informed, and unambiguous, as well as easier to understand for the average user.

4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements as it allows users to give or withdraw their consent for specific purposes. However, it could improve in providing more explicit information about the third parties handling personal data and making the language more accessible for the average user to understand.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Be more explicit about the specific third parties that handle personal data.
   - Improve the clarity of the language used throughout the policy, making it easier for users to understand their rights and the implications of their consent choices.
   - Provide an easily accessible, simplified version of the cookie policy for users who may not be familiar with GDPR terminology."

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user is given an option to explicitly consent to the processing of their personal data for specific purposes. The legal basis for this processing is not explicitly stated in the text provided, but it can be assumed that it is based on the user's consent as per Article 6(1)(a) GDPR.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, the policy provides a mechanism for users to withdraw their consent at any time by clicking on the Privacy Button.
     - Granular Consent: Yes, the policy allows users to consent or refuse to consent to specific purposes of data processing.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides detailed information about the purposes for which personal data is processed, the vendors involved, and the types of cookies used. However, it could be improved by providing more explicit and concise explanations for each purpose.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, the policy discloses the use of third-party vendors for data processing. Clarity Level: High - The list of vendors is comprehensive and detailed.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Compliant, as the policy defines consent as any freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as while the policy allows users to give and withdraw their consent, it does not clearly state whether the processing is necessary for the provision of a service or contract. The policy also lacks transparency in explaining why some vendors may process personal data based on their legitimate business interest.

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR due to the lack of clarity regarding the necessity of processing for a service or contract and the handling of third-party data based on legitimate business interests.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly state the legal basis for processing personal data in addition to consent, such as when necessary for the performance of a contract.
   - Provide more concise explanations for each purpose of data processing and clarify why some vendors may process personal data based on their legitimate business interests.
   - Consider using plain language and simplifying the design of the policy for improved user understanding and usability."

However, it lacks clarity on the legal basis for processing and does not provide granular control over different categories of cookies.
  5. Suggested Enhancements: To meet GDPR requirements, the policy should explicitly state the legal basis for processing, provide clear distinctions between different categories of cookies, and offer granular control over these categories.

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, but only for two categories (Allow All / Reject All). Granular consent is not provided for the various types of cookies (Strictly Necessary Cookies, Performance Cookies, Functional Cookies, Targeting Cookies) as users can't choose which specific cookies they accept. The legal basis for processing cookies could be legitimate interests or consent, but it's not clearly stated.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can change their preferences at any time in the ""Cookies Settings.""
     - Granular Consent: No, improvements are needed to provide clear and granular options for different types of cookies.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, some information about the purpose of cookies is provided (enhance user experience, analyze site usage, marketing purposes), but it's not specific enough for each type of cookie category mentioned above. Additionally, a link to the Cookies Declaration page provides more detailed information.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but clarity level is not adequate as users are not informed about the third parties that may have access to their data through cookies.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the policy doesn't explicitly state that the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as the information and settings provided allow users to give and withdraw their consent, but granularity is lacking in terms of specifying which types of cookies are being accepted.

4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements as it provides a mechanism for obtaining user consent and offers an option to reject or accept all cookies. However, it falls short on providing clear, specific information about the purpose of each type of cookie and allowing granular control over which cookies are accepted.

5. Suggested Enhancements:

     - Explicit Consent: Yes, implied through the user's action of clicking ""Allow all"" or managing cookie preferences. The legal basis for strictly necessary cookies is legitimate interest and for marketing cookies is consent.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can manage their cookie preferences at any time.
     - Granular Consent: Partially compliant, as users cannot separately consent to strictly necessary cookies but can only accept or reject all types of cookies.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, some information about the purpose and categories of cookies is provided. However, more detailed and specific disclosures are needed for each type of cookie.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but the policy does not specify the level of clarity about third-party data handling.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the definition provided in the policy does not match the GDPR's explicit requirement that consent must be ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous"".
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially compliant, as users are able to withdraw their consent but lack granular control over individual cookie types.

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR requirements, as it provides a withdrawal mechanism and offers some transparency about the use of cookies. However, it fails to meet the strict definition of consent under Article 4(11) and does not provide sufficient granular control over individual cookie types, which may lead to issues in demonstrating valid user consent.

5. Suggested Enhancements:

     - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user can choose between 'Allow all cookies', 'Allow selection' and 'Use necessary cookies only'. However, the specific types of cookies and their purposes are not explicitly stated before the consent request. This lack of transparency may not meet the GDPR requirements for explicit consent. (Legal Basis: Article 6(1)(a) - Consent of the data subject)
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can withdraw their consent at any time by changing their cookie settings in the policy. (Legal Justification: Article 7(3) - The data subject has the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time.)
     - Granular Consent: No, granularity is not provided as users are not informed about the specific types of cookies and their purposes before consenting. This does not meet the GDPR requirement for granular consent, which aims to ensure that individuals can give explicit consent to the processing of their personal data for each specific purpose.
     - Data Transparency: Partially Yes, users are informed about the use of cookies but not the specific types of cookies and their purposes before giving consent. This may not meet the GDPR requirement for transparency as it does not allow individuals to fully understand the intended processing of their personal data. (Justification: Article 12 - The controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in paragraph 1 to the data subject in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.)
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but it is not made explicit whether users are informed about the sharing of their data with third parties before giving consent. This lack of clarity may not meet GDPR requirements for transparency in regards to third-party data handling. (Clarity Level: Unclear)
  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, the consent request does not seem to provide a free choice and may not be sufficiently clear for users to understand that they are giving their consent. (Reason: The GDPR requires that ""consent should be given by a clear affirmative act"" and this cookie policy does not meet that requirement.)
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, the user can choose between 'Allow all cookies', 'Allow selection' and 'Use necessary cookies only'. However, the specific types of cookies and their purposes are not explicitly stated before the consent request. This may not meet the GDPR requirement for granularity in consent requests. (Reason: The GDPR requires that the data subject should be able to easily and specifically identify the processing operations for which the controller is seeking consent.)
  4. Final Justification: The primary reason behind classifying this cookie policy as Partially Compliant is that it provides a mechanism for users to give or withdraw their consent, but the specific types of cookies and their purposes are not explicitly stated before the consent request, which may not meet GDPR requirements for transparency and granularity.
  5. Suggested Enhancements:
     - Provide explicit information about the specific types of cookies used, their purposes, and whether they are shared with third parties before the user gives consent.
     - Offer a more granular consent request that allows users to give consent for each specific type of cookie or purpose of processing.

   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as while users are presented with an option to give or withdraw their consent, there is no evidence that they are provided with information about the purpose and legal basis for the processing, the retention period, the right to withdraw consent at any time, etc., as required by Article 7(3) and (4).

4. Final Justification: The cookie policy is partially compliant with GDPR because it provides users with an option to give or withdraw their consent to the use of cookies, but it lacks clarity in certain aspects, such as third-party data handling and the transparency of purposes and legal bases for processing.

     - Explicit Consent: Yes, the policy requests users to accept cookies and acknowledges that they are agreeing to the setting of cookies and their use as well as the subsequent processing of the collected data for personalized advertising and marketing purposes. The legal basis is legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR), but consent is also sought in this case due to the collection of user data.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can adjust their cookie settings at any time according to their wishes. However, the burden on the user to manually manage cookie preferences might not be as straightforward and easy as required by GDPR.
     - Granular Consent: No, the policy does not offer granular options for consenting to each type of cookie. Instead, users are presented with three broad categories (Strictly necessary cookies, Performance cookies, Marketing and targeting cookies) but no specific information about what each category entails.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides a link to more detailed information on the cookies, their purposes, third-party recipients, cookie lifespan, etc., in its Cookie Policy. However, this information should be presented upfront and clearly within the cookie banner for better transparency.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but the policy does not specify the level of clarity regarding third-party data handling. It mentions that personal data may be shared with partners, but more specifics are needed.

  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the policy does not clearly inform users about their right to withdraw consent at any time. The language used in the cookie banner implies that once a user accepts cookies, it is a permanent setting, which contradicts the GDPR's requirement for easy withdrawal.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Non-Compliant, as users are not provided with granular options for consenting to each type of cookie and the transparency requirement is not fully met. Users should be informed about the purposes and third-party data handling related to each type of cookie before they are asked to accept them.

  4. Final Justification: The policy does not meet the strict requirements of GDPR compliance in terms of explicit consent, granularity in consent options, transparency, and easy withdrawal mechanism. Although it provides a cookie banner and allows users to adjust their cookie settings, these aspects need significant improvement for full compliance with GDPR.

  5. Suggested Enhancements:
    1. Offer granular options for consenting to each type of cookie, explaining the purpose and potential third-party data handling associated with each category.
    2. Provide clear information about the right to withdraw consent at any time within the cookie banner.
    3. Present upfront and clearly in the cookie banner the information about cookies' purposes, third-party recipients, cookie lifespan, etc., to improve transparency.
    4. Update the policy language to ensure that users understand they can change their cookie preferences at any time and that this does not require manual intervention."

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, with a legal basis of legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR). However, users' consent is only obtained for all purposes when they click ""Allow all"". To meet the GDPR requirements, explicit consent must be given for each separate purpose.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can revoke their consent at any time via the Privacy Settings at the bottom of the website.
     - Granular Consent: No, as the policy does not allow users to give explicit consent for specific purposes or providers.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, users are informed about the processing purposes, functions, and a list of data processing providers. However, it lacks clarity in explaining how their personal data is being linked across different sources and devices.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, with a Clarity Level of Medium. Users are informed that their data will be shared with 43 partners for various purposes, but more details could be provided about how their personal data is being used by each partner.

  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant. The policy does not provide a clear and concise explanation of what constitutes consent as required under GDPR Article 4(11).
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant. Users are informed about the purposes of data processing, but they can only give consent for all purposes at once instead of individually.

  4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements because it provides transparency about the use of cookies and offers a withdrawal mechanism. However, it fails to meet the GDPR's granular consent requirement, which necessitates separate consent for each purpose and provider.

  5. Suggested Enhancements:
     - Update the policy to obtain explicit consent for specific purposes and providers through separate checkboxes.
     - Provide a clear explanation of what constitutes consent under GDPR Article 4(11).
     - Improve transparency by providing more details about how personal data is being linked across different sources and devices, as well as the use of personal data by each third-party provider."

   The cookie policy provides some necessary elements such as explicit consent, withdrawal mechanism, and transparency about data usage. However, it lacks granularity in obtaining user consent and does not meet all the requirements of Article 7 of GDPR.

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, users are required to actively accept cookies through a clear ""Accept all"" button. However, there is no separate agreement for each purpose or category of cookie which is a requirement under GDPR.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can withdraw their consent at any time by revoking it.
     - Granular Consent: No, as there is not a separate agreement for each purpose or category of cookie.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy informs users about the types of data collected and how it will be used (e.g., analytics, marketing, external content integration).

  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant. The definition provided in this policy does not meet the specific requirements of GDPR. It should be revised to reflect the GDPR's detailed consent definition.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant. Although users are offered the option to accept or decline cookies, the granularity requirement is not met as there is no separate agreement for each purpose or category of cookie.

  4. Final Justification:
     The policy does not fully comply with GDPR requirements due to the lack of granular consent and non-compliance with Article 4(11) (Consent Definition). This may leave the organization vulnerable to potential legal issues related to user privacy and data protection.

  5. Suggested Enhancements:
     - Clearly separate and obtain individual consents for each category of cookie and purpose of data collection.
     - Revise the policy's definition of consent to align with Article 4(11) requirements of GDPR.
     - Provide users with more detailed information about the specific cookies used, their expiration periods, and any third-party providers involved in their use.
     - Offer an easily accessible link or button for users to revoke their consent quickly and easily.
     - Include details on how user data will be protected, especially when transferred to third countries, as well as how data subject rights can be enforced."

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, users are given the option to accept or decline cookies and different categories of processing purposes. However, it does not provide a clear legal basis for processing.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can revoke their consent at any time under ""Cookie Settings"" at the bottom of the page.
     - Granular Consent: Yes, users are given the option to customize their preferences.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, some information about the cookies and processing purposes is provided, but it could be more explicit regarding the specific data being collected, processed, and the purpose of such collection.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, with clarity level Moderate, as users are informed that their data may be transferred outside the EU/EEA to third parties like Adobe, Facebook, Google, etc., but details about each third party and specific purposes of data transfer are not explicitly stated.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the policy does not clearly define consent in line with the GDPR definition, which requires that it is ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous."" The policy only provides a general explanation but lacks clarity about the exact nature of the consent being obtained.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant, as users are provided with clear and concise information about the processing activities and given the option to accept or refuse. However, the legal basis for processing is not explicitly mentioned, which may raise concerns under GDPR requirements.

4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements as it provides some transparency about cookie usage and offers users a choice. However, it falls short in clearly defining consent in accordance with GDPR, providing explicit legal basis for processing, and offering full transparency regarding the specific data being collected and transferred to third parties.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly define consent in line with GDPR requirements, explaining that users' consent is necessary for certain processing activities.
   - Provide explicit legal basis for each category of processing activities.
   - Offer full transparency regarding the specific data being collected, processed, and transferred to third parties, including detailed information about each third party and their purposes.
   - Simplify language and make it easier for users to understand the implications of accepting or refusing cookies and the associated processing activities."

     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides information about the types of cookies used and their purposes.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but clarity could be improved by stating explicitly who these third parties are and how they process data.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant. The policy does not provide a clear statement that consent is ""specific, informed and unambiguous"". It could be improved by using more explicit language.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant. Users are provided with clear information about the processing activities and given an easy-to-use method to give and withdraw their consent.

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it does not provide explicit language for the consent definition as required by Article 4(11) GDPR, but it does offer users a choice in giving and withdrawing their consent.

   - Ensure that the basis for processing under Article 6 is clearly stated."
legal_analysis,non_compliant,non_compliant-8.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Legal Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, with the legal basis being consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. However, granular consent is not fully met as users cannot provide or refuse consent for individual categories of cookies (e.g., separate acceptance for statistics and marketing cookies).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can change or revoke their consent at any time in the Privacy Information section.
     - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, as granular consent is required but not fully provided. Users cannot individually accept or refuse different categories of cookies.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, users are informed about the use of cookies and their purpose (to enhance user experience, display advertising based on interests, etc.).
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, with Clarity Level: The policy mentions third-party cookies but does not specify which third parties are involved or provide enough information about their data handling practices.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Partially Compliant, as the policy defines consent in a general way rather than using the specific definition provided in Article 4(11). This can be improved by explicitly stating that consent is ""any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes.""
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant. Although users are given the option to provide or revoke their consent, granular consent is not fully met as they cannot accept or refuse different categories of cookies separately. This can be improved by providing clear and separate options for each category of cookie.

4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements regarding cookie use, but it fails to provide granular consent options for users, which is essential under Article 7. This lack of granularity may pose issues during potential audits or enforcement actions by supervisory authorities.

5. Suggested Enhancements: To meet legal requirements and ensure GDPR compliance, the following enhancements should be considered:
   - Provide separate options for each category of cookie (necessary, preference, statistics, marketing, unclassified) to allow users to give or revoke their consent for individual categories.
   - Clearly state the specific definition of consent provided in Article 4(11) GDPR.
   - Specify which third parties are involved in handling cookies and provide more information about their data handling practices.
   - Review and possibly revise the cookie categories and details to ensure accurate classification."

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, but the user is required to actively click ""Allow all"" or make specific selections to provide consent for various purposes (although necessary cookies are always active and cannot be deactivated). The legal basis for processing personal data should be explicitly stated.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can revoke their consent at any time by accessing the Privacy Settings at the bottom of the website.
     - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, as users can customize their preferences, but the necessity of clicking ""Allow all"" for full compliance may not meet GDPR requirements.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the Cookie Policy provides information about the types of data processed and the purposes for which it is used. However, more specific details about each provider and subservice could be included for greater transparency.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but the level of clarity could be improved by providing a more comprehensive list of third parties, including their names and functions.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Compliant, as the definition of consent is given in the policy, but it could be made clearer that consent should be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as users are provided with the option to choose their preferences, but the requirement for active opt-in for all purposes may not meet GDPR standards.

4. Final Justification: The Cookie Policy is partially compliant because it provides some transparency about data processing and offers a mechanism for users to revoke their consent. However, it may not fully comply with GDPR requirements due to the active opt-in requirement for all purposes, lack of clarity on third-party data handling, and potential ambiguity in the definition of consent.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly state the legal basis for processing personal data (e.g., legitimate interests or contractual necessity).
   - Provide a more straightforward way for users to provide explicit consent for all purposes without requiring an active opt-in for necessary cookies.
   - Improve clarity on third-party data handling by providing a comprehensive list of providers, their functions, and any subservices they may use.
   - Make the definition of consent clearer, emphasizing that it must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.
   - Offer more granular control over data processing purposes to ensure compliance with GDPR standards for obtaining user consent."

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, however, it is not clear if the user's consent is specific and informed for each type of cookie (Granular Consent) or just a blanket approval for all cookies. The legal basis seems to be legitimate interest in providing a personalized user experience.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can adjust their consent at any time with effect for the future by clicking on ""Cookie Settings"" in the website footer.
     - Granular Consent: No, as it is not clear if the user's consent is specific and informed for each type of cookie.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy explains the types of cookies used and their purposes. However, clarity could be improved regarding third-party data handling.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but clarity level could be improved. The policy mentions multiple third parties, but it is not clear how these third parties handle user data or if they have their own cookie policies.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant. The consent definition in the policy does not meet the GDPR requirement of being ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous"". The user is presented with a blanket approval for all cookies, which may not be freely given or specific.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Non-Compliant. The consent obtained does not satisfy the GDPR requirement of being granular, explicit, and fully informed as it is not clear if the user's consent is specific and informed for each type of cookie.

4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR because it provides some transparency about the use of cookies, offers a withdrawal mechanism, and allows users to adjust their consent. However, it does not fully comply because it lacks granular consent and fails to meet the GDPR requirement for specific and informed consent.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Make granular consent explicit by providing separate options for each category of cookie (essential, marketing, statistical).
   - Improve transparency regarding third-party data handling by explaining how these third parties handle user data and linking to their respective cookie policies.
   - Ensure the language used in the policy is clear and unambiguous to facilitate users' understanding of what they are consenting to.

     - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user is asked to explicitly accept or reject cookies. However, the initial consent is not specific as it does not provide a granular choice for each type of cookie. (Legal Basis: Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR)
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, the user can access and revoke their consent at any time via the Cookie Policy. (Legal Justification: Art. 7(3) GDPR)
     - Granular Consent: No, the user is not offered a granular choice for each type of cookie. (Justification: A more detailed breakdown of cookies would help users make informed decisions about which cookies they consent to.)
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the user is informed about the purpose and categories of cookies used on the website. (Justification: This transparency helps users understand how their data will be used and processed.)
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but there is no clarity on whether third-parties have access to personal data or not. (Clarity Level: Improvements needed in disclosing this information to the user.)

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy does not explicitly state that consent is ""any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which they, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signify agreement to the processing of personal data relating to them."" Instead, it uses the term 'agreement' without specifying the consent definition. (Reason: Modify the policy to explicitly use the GDPR-defined consent.)
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy partially complies with this article as it provides information about the purposes of data processing and offers a way to withdraw consent. However, it does not offer a granular choice for each type of cookie, which is a requirement under GDPR. (Reason: Improve the granularity of the consent mechanism to meet this requirement.)

4. Final Justification: The policy only partially complies with GDPR because it lacks clarity and granularity in its consent mechanism. This may lead to confusion among users about how their data is being used and processed, which could potentially breach the principles of transparency and informed consent as outlined by GDPR.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Offer a granular choice for each type of cookie (strictly necessary, performance, functional, targeting) to give users more control over their data processing preferences.
   - Clearly define consent in line with the GDPR-defined consent and provide detailed information about third-party data handling practices.
   - Improve transparency by explaining why cookies are used for each category (e.g., performance cookies are used to improve website speed).
   - Provide clearer language and examples to help users understand their rights and the potential risks associated with certain cookie settings, such as data transfer to the USA."

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user can either accept all cookies or customize preferences by selecting essential, functional, and advertising cookies (however, the 'Accept All' option does not explicitly name each type of cookie). The legal basis for processing is legitimate interest for necessary cookies, and consent for non-essential cookies.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can modify their preferences at any time, and there is a clear method to reject all cookies or only allow essential ones.
     - Granular Consent: Yes, users have the option to customize their cookie preferences in granular detail by selecting required, functional, and advertising cookies.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, a brief description of the purpose of each type of cookie is provided (error-free operation, analysis & performance improvements, user-friendliness enhancements, advertising purposes). However, more detailed information about specific cookies and their providers should be included for full transparency.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, it's clear that third-party cookies are used for advertising purposes, but the policy lacks clarity regarding other third-parties that may handle data on this website.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Compliant, as the definition of consent is provided in the Cookie Policy and it aligns with the GDPR's definition.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Non-Compliant, while users have the option to give or withdraw their consent, the information provided about each type of cookie does not meet the standard of specificity and clarity required by Article 7(4) of the GDPR.

4. Final Justification: The Cookie Policy is partially compliant with GDPR requirements due to its lack of detail in informing users about individual cookies and their purposes, which contradicts the requirement for explicit, granular, and informed consent under Article 7(4).

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Provide a detailed list of specific cookies used on the website, along with their providers, purpose, retention period, and any third-party links to their own cookie policies.
   - Expand upon the brief descriptions of each type of cookie to include more specific information about what data is being collected, how it will be used, and who it may be shared with.

     - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user can choose among three options (Accept All, Only Required, and Settings) to grant or withdraw their consent for different types of cookies. However, the initial setting for analytics and marketing cookies is set to off but marked as ""Requires Consent."" It should be set to off by default and not require explicit consent since it does not fall under Article 6(1)(a) legal basis (consent).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, the user can withdraw their consent at any time through the Settings option.
     - Granular Consent: Yes, users are provided with options to selectively accept or reject different types of cookies.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides a reasonable level of transparency about the use of cookies and the data processing. However, it does not specify what personal data is being collected, for what purpose, and the retention period.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, the policy mentions that third-party partners may access and process users' data. The clarity level could be improved by clearly stating which specific third parties are involved and their respective roles.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Partially Compliant, as the user consent for analytics and marketing cookies is not collected under a valid legal basis according to the definition in this article.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as the initial setting of analytics and marketing cookies is not compliant with the conditions for consent specified in this article.

4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements because it offers users the ability to grant or withdraw their consent and provides some transparency about data processing. However, it does not ensure a valid legal basis for collecting user consent for analytics and marketing cookies, which are key aspects of GDPR compliance.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Revise the initial setting of analytics and marketing cookies to be off by default, as they do not require explicit consent according to Article 6(1)(a) legal basis (consent).
   - Clearly state which specific third parties are involved in data processing and specify the purpose and retention period for collecting personal data.
   - Review the policy language to ensure that the provided information is accurate, concise, transparent, and easily understandable for users.
   - Implement a mechanism for periodic review of the policy to keep it up-to-date with any changes in the processing activities or relevant laws and regulations."

2. Legal Justification:
   - Explicit Consent: Yes, users are given options to accept or reject all cookies and tracking. However, the consent for necessary cookies is implicit as they cannot be disabled, which may not meet GDPR standards for granular consent. (Legal Basis: Legitimate Interest - Art. 6(1)(f))
   - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can adjust their settings at any time to withdraw their consent. (Legal Justification: Right of withdrawal under Art. 7(3) and Art. 21(2) GDPR)
   - Granular Consent: Partially compliant as necessary cookies cannot be declined. (Justification: GDPR requires granular consent for all types of cookies except strictly necessary ones, but this policy does not meet the standard due to the inability to decline necessary cookies.)
   - Data Transparency: Yes, users are provided with clear information about the purpose and categories of cookies used. (Justification: Art. 12(1) GDPR requires transparency and easily accessible information to data subjects.)
   - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, the policy mentions that third-party partners will have access to data collected via cookies for marketing and analysis purposes. (Clarity Level: Clear)

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Compliant as the policy provides an unambiguous and specific statement of consent to process personal data using cookies. (Reason: The definition of consent under GDPR is met by providing users with clear choices regarding cookie usage.)
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially compliant as consent is not freely given due to the inability to decline necessary cookies and default settings may not be clearly distinguished from active user choices. (Reason: The GDPR states that consent should be a conscious and affirmative act, which this policy does not fully meet.)

4. Final Justification:
The policy is partially compliant as it provides users with the option to manage their cookie preferences and offers transparency about data usage. However, the inability to decline necessary cookies may not comply with GDPR's granular consent requirement, which could potentially lead to non-compliance under Article 7.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Allow users to decline necessary cookies, making it possible for users to give truly granular consent that complies with the GDPR's standard.
   - Clearly distinguish default settings from active user choices in the cookie settings section. This will ensure that users are aware of their initial choices and can make informed decisions about their data usage.
   - Provide a clear and concise explanation of why necessary cookies cannot be declined to address any potential confusion or concerns regarding GDPR compliance.
   - Review the default settings for marketing, analysis, and social network cookies to ensure that they are not actively enabled without user consent. This will help meet the requirements for freely given and informed consent under Article 7 of the GDPR."

     - Explicit Consent: Yes, but not specific as Article 7 requires, as the legal basis for processing is not clearly stated. The user's choice to accept or reject cookies does not equate to explicit consent.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can change their cookie preferences at any time.
     - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, as users can choose between three options (accept all, reject non-essential, and customize), but the granularity of consents is not clear enough, especially for marketing cookies.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides some information about the purpose of cookies and their storage locations. However, it lacks clarity regarding specific data processing activities, particularly for third-party cookies like LinkedIn retargeting cookies.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but not clearly enough. The policy mentions that data may be accessed from various countries, including the USA, and LinkedIn retargeting cookies are used, but it does not explicitly state how user data is shared with third parties or what safeguards are in place for such transfers.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the cookie policy does not provide a clear and affirmative action by which the data subject has given consent to the processing of their personal data. The option to 'accept all cookies' is not active consent but rather an act of acceptance or acknowledgment.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Non-Compliant, as the information provided in the cookie policy does not meet the requirements for free and informed consent. Users are not provided with clear, specific, and separate options to give their consent for each type of processing activity.

4. Final Justification: The cookie policy is partially compliant due to its lack of clarity regarding the legal basis for processing and insufficient granularity in obtaining user consent. The main issue is that users are not provided with clear, specific, and separate options to give their informed and explicit consent for each type of data processing activity.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly state the legal basis for each category of cookies (e.g., legitimate interest, contractual necessity) in the cookie policy.
   - Provide a more granular approach to obtaining user consent by offering separate options for each type of processing activity (e.g., statistics/range measurement, marketing).
   - Specify how user data is shared with third parties and what safeguards are in place for such transfers, particularly when the data may be accessed from countries like the USA where public authorities might access data without legal recourse.
   - Ensure that users give explicit consent by using active opt-in mechanisms instead of passive opt-out mechanisms.
   - Update the policy to provide more detailed information about the purposes of each type of cookie, including marketing cookies, and their storage locations."

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user can choose to accept all cookies or select necessary and functional cookies only. However, targeting cookies do not have an explicit opt-in mechanism. (Legal Basis: Contract, Legitimate Interest)
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can change their cookie preferences at any time.
     - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, as there is no explicit opt-in for targeting cookies.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides some information about the types of cookies used and their purposes. However, more detailed information about third-party data handling is needed.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but the level of clarity is unclear as there is no specific mention of which third parties may collect or process personal data through cookies.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the consent mechanism does not clearly distinguish between necessary and essential cookies and those for which consent is required (e.g., functional and targeting cookies).
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant, as users are informed about their choices regarding cookies. However, the lack of explicit opt-in for targeting cookies may be a concern.

4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR because it provides some transparency and allows users to manage their cookie preferences. However, it falls short in obtaining valid consent for all types of cookies as required by Article 7. The lack of an explicit opt-in for targeting cookies poses a potential risk of non-compliance.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Make explicit opt-ins mandatory for all types of cookies, including functional and targeting cookies.
   - Provide more detailed information about third-party data handling, including who these parties are and the purposes for which they may collect or process personal data.
   - Clarify the distinction between necessary (always active) and functional cookies that require consent in the user interface.
   - Ensure that the consent mechanism is compliant with Article 4(11) to ensure a valid and unambiguous user consent."

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, with the option to accept all cookies or customize preferences (although the 'Marketing & Personalization' category is enabled by default and requires consent). The legal basis for processing personal data through cookies is consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can modify their cookie settings at any time.
     - Granular Consent: Partially compliant. While users can select different categories of cookies, the 'Marketing & Personalization' category is enabled by default and requires explicit consent, which may not be fully granular as users have no choice to deny this category without disabling all cookies.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, users are informed about the purposes of data processing and the third-party partners involved (Google). However, more specific information on the types of personal data collected, data retention periods, and potential data transfers to non-EU countries could be added for increased transparency.
    3. Compliance with Articles:
       - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Compliant, as the policy defines consent as ""any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.""
       - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially compliant. Although users can grant consent and withdraw it at any time, the 'Marketing & Personalization' category is enabled by default, potentially leading to a lack of informed consent.
    4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it provides information about cookies, offers a mechanism for consent and withdrawal, and enables users to customize their preferences. However, the potential lack of informed consent due to the 'Marketing & Personalization' category being enabled by default may not meet the specificity required by Article 7(4) GDPR.
    5. Suggested Enhancements:
        1. Clearly explain that cookies are used for targeted advertising and data sharing with third parties, ensuring this information is provided prior to enabling any non-essential cookies.
        2. Remove the default activation of the 'Marketing & Personalization' category and require explicit consent from users before enabling these cookies.
        3. Provide more detailed information about the types of personal data collected, data retention periods, and potential data transfers to non-EU countries within the policy or link to a separate privacy policy document that covers this information.
        4. Implement a mechanism to periodically remind users to review their cookie settings and manage their preferences as required by Article 7(3) GDPR."

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, but the policy lacks specificity regarding the legal basis for processing personal data and how it relates to each category of cookie. The ""Legal Basis"" section is missing.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can change their consent at any time via the ""Review and change your consent"" button on the Cookie Policy page.
     - Granular Consent: Yes, but more information should be provided to help users understand why specific cookies are being used.
     - Data Transparency: Partially compliant, as some information is provided about the types of cookies used and their purposes, but further details are needed regarding the legal basis for data processing and the identities of third-party partners.
  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the policy does not clearly state that consent is ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous"" (emphasis added for clarity). The lack of information about the legal basis for data processing contributes to this non-compliance.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as users are provided with a choice regarding cookies, but more transparency is needed about the purpose and nature of data processing.
  4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it provides some information about the types of cookies used and gives users the ability to manage their preferences. However, it does not meet all the requirements for GDPR compliance due to a lack of specificity regarding the legal basis for data processing, transparency about third-party partners, and the freestyle nature of consent.
  5. Suggested Enhancements:
     - Clearly state the legal basis for data processing in each cookie category (e.g., legitimate interests, contractual necessity, or consent).
     - Provide detailed information about third-party partners that may receive user data, including their identities and purposes of the data processing.
     - Improve transparency by explaining the specific purposes and nature of data processing for each cookie category.
     - Include a clear explanation of how users can withdraw their consent at any time, beyond just providing a button to change preferences. This could include information about cookies that are necessary for website functionality and the potential consequences of disabling them."

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, but not specific enough (Legal Basis: Legitimate Interest and/or Contract)
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, provided through Cookie and Advertising Settings (Legal Justification: Right to withdraw consent at any time)
     - Granular Consent: Partially (Justification: Some granularity is given for essential cookies, but not for third-party advertising cookies)
     - Data Transparency: Yes, but information could be more detailed and accessible (Justification: Users should have a clear understanding of the purpose and recipients of their data)
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, with some clarity level (Clarity Level: Could benefit from specifying third-party providers by name or category)

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant (Reason: The policy does not provide a clear and affirmative action to give consent, making it unspecific and not easily distinguishable)
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant (Reason: While explicit consent is given through the ""Accept"" button, granularity could be improved and transparency increased)

4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR regulations, but it lacks specificity and clarity in terms of obtaining explicit consent for data processing purposes, providing granular options for users to control their cookie preferences, and ensuring transparency regarding the use of personal data for advertising purposes.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly define and separate essential cookies from third-party advertising cookies
   - Provide a more detailed list of third-party providers using cookies on this service
   - Offer granular options for users to control their cookie preferences, including the ability to accept or reject specific types of cookies (e.g., analytics, marketing, functionality)
   - Improve transparency by providing clear and concise explanations for each type of cookie used, its purpose, and the legal basis for processing personal data with it

2. Legal Justification:
   - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user is given clear choices to accept or decline cookies and can also configure individual preferences. However, it's not entirely clear which cookies fall under ""necessary"" and ""non-necessary"" categories. The legal basis for processing personal data should be specified (e.g., legitimate interests).
   - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can change or revoke consent at any time via the cookie settings link.
   - Granular Consent: Partially compliant. While users can configure individual preferences, it's not entirely clear what specific data is being collected for each type of cookie (functional, statistics, marketing).
   - Data Transparency: Yes, some information about the purpose of cookies and third-party services using cookies is provided. However, more detailed information should be given to ensure full transparency regarding the processing of personal data.
   - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but the level of clarity is moderate. The user is informed that third-party services like Adobe Analytics, Google Ads, HubSpot, LinkedIn Insight Tag, Meta Pixel, Microsoft Advertising, YouTube Video, and Google Maps are used, but it's not clear how these services process personal data.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-compliant. The policy does not explicitly state that the consent is ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous"" as required by the GDPR.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially compliant. While the user is given a choice to accept or decline cookies, more detailed information about each category of cookie should be provided to ensure that the consent is informed and specific.

4. Final Justification: The policy partially meets GDPR requirements, but it lacks clarity in certain aspects such as the legal basis for processing personal data, the specific data being collected for each type of cookie, and a more detailed explanation of third-party data handling.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly specify the legal basis for processing personal data (e.g., legitimate interests).
   - Provide a detailed breakdown of the specific data being collected for each category of cookie (functional, statistics, marketing).
   - Offer more detailed information about how third-party services using cookies process personal data, including any data retention periods and the right to object to processing.
   - Ensure that the consent is ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous"" as required by Article 4(11) of the GDPR.

     - Make the language in the policy clearer and easier to understand, ensuring users can make informed decisions about their personal data.
     - Provide a simple way for users to revoke consent for individual purposes, rather than only offering an ""Edit or Decline"" option for all cookies.
     - Consider obtaining explicit consent for third-party vendors, as their use of cookies may not always be necessary for the website's core functionality.

   - The policy provides some transparency about the use of cookies and offers a mechanism to withdraw consent, but it could be more explicit and granular in obtaining user consent for different categories of cookies.

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes. Users are informed about the use of cookies and asked for their consent before any non-essential cookies are deployed. The legal basis for processing personal data through cookies is Article 6(1)(a) GDPR, which concerns consent.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes. Users can withdraw their consent at any time via the Cookie Manager or privacy policy link.
     - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant. While users are given an option to accept all cookies, there is no granular control over which specific categories of cookies they want to allow or reject.
     - Data Transparency: Yes. Users are provided with information about the purpose and types of cookies used, as well as links to further details. However, more specifics on third-party data handling could be added for clarity.

  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Compliant. The policy uses a clear and affirmative action by the user to consent to non-essential cookies, aligning with the GDPR's definition of consent.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant. While users are informed about their options, the ability to give or withdraw granular consent could improve compliance with this article.

  4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements by informing users about cookies and providing a mechanism to withdraw consent. However, it lacks granularity in obtaining user consent for different categories of cookies, which is essential for full compliance with Article 7.

  5. Suggested Enhancements:
     - Provide more specific information on third-party data handling in the cookie policy, to ensure clarity and transparency.
     - Implement granular control for users to accept or reject different categories of cookies, rather than offering only an 'accept all' option. This will help meet GDPR requirements for explicit and informed consent under Article 7."

  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Compliant, as the policy explains what consent means in this context and how it can be withdrawn.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as not all cookies have a specific legal basis explicitly stated, which is required under Article 7(4).
  4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR because it provides some information about the types of cookies used and offers users the ability to manage their preferences.

     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, the policy provides an option to withdraw consent at any time using the cookie settings button. However, it's not clear if this withdrawal applies to third-party cookies as well. (Legal Justification: Article 7(3) - Right to withdraw consent)
     - Granular Consent: No, users are only given a choice between accepting all cookies or necessary cookies only, without the option to select specific types of cookies. (Justification: Improved transparency and control for users)
     - Data Transparency: Yes, some information about the purpose, expiration, provider, and type of each cookie is provided. However, it could be more detailed, especially for third-party cookies. (Justification: To provide full transparency to users about data processing activities)

     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes (users can change their preferences at any time by clicking on ""Manage consent preferences"" in cookie settings) - Legal Justification: This allows users to withdraw their consent, which is a key requirement under GDPR.
     - Granular Consent: No (there are no options for individual consent to specific types of cookies) - Justification: The policy does not allow users to provide granular consent, which could be improved for better transparency and control over the data being collected.

     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes (no explicit mention of third-party cookies but the use of marketing cookies implies this) - Clarity Level: Medium (the policy could be more specific about which third parties handle data).

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant - Reason: The definition of consent provided in the policy does not explicitly meet the GDPR standard, as it uses an implied consent mechanism rather than actively requiring users to opt-in.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant - Reason: Users are provided with clear and comprehensive information about the processing activities, and their consent is obtained through the ""Accept all"" and ""Reject all"" options, giving them control over their data.

4. Final Justification: The policy does not fully comply with GDPR requirements because it does not provide granular consent options for specific types of cookies, and the definition of consent could be improved to meet the GDPR standard.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Implement granular consent options for each category of cookie (strictly necessary, performance, marketing).
   - Clarify the definition of consent in line with GDPR standards by actively requiring users to opt-in, rather than using an implied consent mechanism.
   - Provide more detailed information about the specific purposes of each type of cookie and the third parties involved in data handling.

     - Explicit Consent: Yes, but not all purposes for data processing are clearly distinguished and separated (Article 7(4) GDPR). The use of cookies for marketing purposes does not have a separate consent checkbox.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can withdraw their consent at any time with future effect by clicking ""Settings"" and changing their preferences or closing the banner.
     - Granular Consent: No, not all purposes for data processing are presented separately with an individual consent checkbox.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, but it could be improved by providing more detailed information about each purpose for data processing and the specific vendors used on the website within the settings section.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, third parties may have access to the user's data, but there is no clarity regarding the specific third parties involved or if they are located outside the European Economic Area (EEA).

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the consent language does not clearly distinguish between necessary and optional cookies and provide a choice that is specific, informed, and freely given (Article 4(11)(a)).
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant, but with reservations due to the lack of granularity in obtaining consent. Users should be able to give and withdraw consent for each individual purpose and vendor involved (Article 7(2) and (4)).

4. Final Justification: The cookie policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it provides a withdrawal mechanism, some transparency, and the ability to object to audience measurement. However, it does not meet the strict requirements for explicit consent by failing to distinguish between necessary and optional cookies and provide separate checkboxes for each purpose and vendor involved.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly distinguish between necessary and optional cookies and provide separate checkboxes for each purpose (e.g., technical, audience measurement, performance, functional, marketing) and the specific vendors used on the website within the settings section.
   - Provide more detailed information about each purpose for data processing and the specific third parties involved in handling users' data, especially if they are located outside the EEA.
   - Ensure that the language used in obtaining consent is clear, concise, and unambiguous, providing a genuine choice to users (Article 7(4)).
   - Include information about the potential risks associated with the processing of personal data outside the EEA (Article 49 GDPR)."

2. Legal Justification:
   - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user is given an option to either ""Deny All"" or ""Accept All"". However, the level of specificity in informing users about the purpose and type of data collected is not detailed enough as required by GDPR. (Legal Basis: Article 6(1)(a))
   - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, the user can revoke their consent at any time. (Legal Justification: Article 7(3) and 12(2))
   - Granular Consent: No, as users are not given a choice to select specific categories of cookies they accept or reject. (Justification: The principle of transparency requires users to be informed about the purposes for which personal data is processed and have control over their choices.)
   - Data Transparency: Yes, users are provided with information about where they can find comprehensive details regarding the use of cookies and the privacy policy. However, this information is not adequately detailed within the cookie policy itself. (Justification: Article 12(1) requires that personal data must be processed in a transparent manner.)
   - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but clarity level is poor as it is not mentioned which third parties have access to the users' data and for what purposes. (Clarity Level: Low)

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the definition of consent provided does not meet the GDPR standard of being 'freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous'. The user is presented with only two options, which can be seen as ambiguous.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as users are given a choice but the level of specificity in informing them about the purpose and type of data collected does not meet GDPR requirements.

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR due to the lack of granularity in obtaining explicit consent and failing to meet the standard for transparency as required by Article 4(11) and 7.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly define what each category of cookies (essential, functional and analytical, marketing and social media) is used for in order to provide users with a granular choice.
   - Explain the purpose and legal basis for data processing by third-party services listed (e.g., Cloudflare, Google Tag Manager, Usercentrics Consent Management Platform, Adobe Target, ContentSquare, Google Ads Conversion Tracking, Google Analytics, Google Maps, LinkedIn Analytics, walls.io, YouTube Video, ID to request consent data).
   - Make the information about cookies and their purposes more transparent within the cookie policy itself rather than just referring users to other documents (e.g., privacy policy)."

     - Data Transparency: Partially Compliant, while the policy provides some information about the purpose of using cookies, it does not provide sufficient transparency regarding the identity of third-party data processors or the types of personal data processed.
  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, while the user is asked for consent, it is not explicitly clear that they are giving their unambiguous and informed consent for specific purposes as required by the definition in Article 4(11).
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant, as the user's consent is specific, informed, and freely given.
  4. Final Justification: The cookie policy is partially compliant with GDPR because it provides a withdrawal mechanism and offers granular consent, but it falls short in providing sufficient transparency about third-party data processors and the types of personal data processed. This may leave room for improvement in meeting the requirements set out in Article 4(11) regarding the definition of consent.
  5. Suggested Enhancements:
     - List the identities of all third-party data processors used by Daimler Truck AG.
     - Provide more detailed information about the types of personal data that will be processed for each category of cookies (technically required, analysis and statistics, convenience).
     - Clarify the wording of the consent request to ensure it meets the requirements set out in Article 4(11) regarding the definition of consent. This may involve providing more information about the purposes for which personal data will be processed and the consequences of withholding consent."

  2. Legal Justification:
   - Explicit Consent: Yes, with the legal basis being Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR (the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data). However, there is no clear specification of each type of cookie and its respective purpose.
   - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can withdraw their consent at any time by adjusting their settings in the 'Adjust' option.
   - Granular Consent: Partially compliant, as users are provided with the opportunity to give or refuse consent for specific purposes (e.g., technically necessary cookies, comfort, statistics, marketing/self-promotion). However, there is no explicit mention of whether data processing for advertising partners is individually customizable.
   - Data Transparency: Partially compliant, as users are informed about the types of cookies and their respective purposes. However, detailed information on each technique and data processing method should be provided in a more straightforward manner for increased transparency.
   - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, with clarity level (adequate), as the policy identifies advertising partners involved in data processing.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the policy does not clearly state that consent is ""any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.""
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant, as the policy provides information about the purposes of the processing, the right to withdraw consent at any time, and the possible consequences of not providing consent. However, it is not explicit enough in explaining how personal data will be used by third parties.

4. Final Justification: The cookie policy partially complies with GDPR requirements, as it provides users with some control over their data through granular consent options. However, it fails to meet the transparency and clear communication standards of Article 4(11) and could potentially mislead users regarding the nature and purpose of their consent.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clarify the definition of consent in accordance with Article 4(11).
   - Provide more straightforward information about each technique, including its respective purpose, to enhance transparency.
   - Make it clear that users can individually customize their consent settings for each advertising partner involved in data processing.
   - Expand on the consequences of refusing consent to help users make informed decisions."

     - Explicit Consent: Yes, but the language could be clearer about the types of personal data being collected and the purposes for which they are processed (Legal Basis: Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can revoke or change their consent at any time through the ""Cookie Settings"".
     - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, as users can select individual categories of cookies to accept or deny but there is no clear explanation about what each category entails.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, users are provided with information about the purpose of cookies and the option to learn more in the privacy policy. However, it would be more transparent if the categories were explained directly in the cookie banner.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but there is no clear indication of how third-party data is handled (Clarity Level: Poor).

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the policy does not explicitly state that consent must be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as the requirement for a clear and affirmative action is met but the transparency and granularity could be improved.

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR requirements because it allows users to give and withdraw consent, however, it does not provide sufficient information about the data being collected, the purposes for which it is used, and how third-party data is handled.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly define each cookie category in the banner or provide a link to detailed explanations.
   - Improve transparency by explaining the types of personal data being collected, the purposes for which they are processed, and how third-party data is handled.
   - Revise the policy language to ensure it explicitly meets the GDPR definition of consent (Art. 4(11)).

     - Explicit Consent: Yes, users are asked to consent explicitly when they enter the website and can withdraw their consent at any time. The legal basis for processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO (consent).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can change their settings or revoke their consent at any time by clicking on the cookie button at the bottom of the website.
     - Granular Consent: Partially compliant. Users are presented with different categories of cookies, but it is not clear whether each specific cookie or function within those categories has been individually consented to.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, users are informed about the processing purposes and the data protection information can be found on the website. However, more detailed information on specific cookies and functions used could be provided for greater transparency.

Clarity level is moderate as users are informed about this but more specific details on data handling by third parties could be provided for better clarity.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, the consent language used does not meet the strict requirements of GDPR for clear and affirmative actions signifying a freely given specific and informed indication of a data subject's wishes by which they, by statement or by clear affirmative action, signify agreement to the processing of personal data relating to them.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, users are provided with an option to give their consent but more granular and specific information on each cookie and function used should be provided for true informed consent.

4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR as it provides users with the opportunity to give or withdraw consent, but it could be improved to provide greater transparency and granularity in the consent process, particularly regarding individual cookies and functions.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly define each cookie and function used on the website and provide an option for users to individually consent to each one.
   - Simplify the language used in the consent request to ensure it meets the strict requirements of GDPR for clear and affirmative actions.
   - Include more detailed information about data handling by third parties, especially in light of the ECJ's classification of the USA as a country with an insufficient level of data protection under EU standards."

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user is asked to accept cookies before they can access the site. However, the consent is not specific (granular) as users are only given three options: Reject All, Accept All (Old Design), Cookies Settings (Modern). The 'Accept All' option does not provide a detailed explanation of all types of cookies and their purposes.

   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Non-Compliant] The consent mechanism does not meet the GDPR definition of consent as it is not specific, freely given, and easily withdrawable.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] The policy provides some information about the types of cookies and their purposes, but this information is not clear, concise, and user-friendly enough to allow the data subject to make an informed decision.

4. Final Justification: The cookie policy does not comply with GDPR requirements as it does not provide a granular, specific, freely given, easily withdrawable consent mechanism for users, nor does it provide clear and concise information about the types of cookies and their purposes.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Provide a granular cookie consent mechanism that allows users to selectively accept or reject different categories of cookies (e.g., strictly necessary, functional, targeting).
   - Clearly explain the purpose of each category of cookie and provide more detailed information about the data processing activities associated with each category.
   - Improve the user-friendliness of the consent mechanism by making it easier for users to understand their options and exercise their choices.
   - Provide a clear and accessible way for users to withdraw their consent at any time.

     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, the user can change their cookie settings at any time.
     - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, as users are given options for marketing and functional cookies, but essential cookies are not separately manageable.
     - Data Transparency: Partially Compliant, detailed information about individual cookies is provided in the ""more settings"" section, although it could be made more user-friendly.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, with clarity as the third-party services used are listed and categorized.
  3. Compliance with Articles:

     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant, as the user is given a free choice and the legitimate interests of the bank are respected. However, the explicitness and granularity of consent could be improved.
  4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements due to its lack of clarity in defining consent (Article 4(11)) and the need for more granular control over cookie preferences (Article 7).
  5. Suggested Enhancements:
    - Clearly define consent according to Article 4(11) guidelines, ensuring it is freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.
    - Offer a more granular approach to managing cookies, allowing users to accept or refuse essential, marketing, and functional cookies individually.

     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, the use of third-party cookies is disclosed but the clarity level can be improved by explicitly stating that data may be shared with third parties for specific purposes.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, while the policy does ask for consent, it does not provide a clear and affirmative action to opt in or out of data processing operations. A positive action, such as clicking an 'Accept' button, is required for a valid consent under GDPR.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, the policy provides some information about the processing purposes, but it lacks clarity on the legal basis for processing, data retention period, and the possibility to withdraw consent easily at any time.

4. Final Justification: The cookie policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it asks for user consent but fails to meet all necessary requirements such as providing a clear and affirmative action for opting in or out, clarifying the legal basis for processing, and ensuring transparency about data retention periods and the possibility to withdraw consent easily.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly state the legal basis for each type of cookie (e.g., legitimate interests, contractual necessity).
   - Provide a clear affirmative action for opting in or out of data processing operations (e.g., checkboxes for each category of cookies instead of an 'Accept All' and 'Deny All' option).
   - Expand the information provided about each cookie to include the purpose, data retention period, and recipients of the data.
   - Simplify the consent management platform by clearly distinguishing between necessary and non-necessary cookies.

     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, the policy provides a mechanism for users to withdraw their consent by changing settings at any time.
     - Granular Consent: No, while users can manage their consent preferences, it is not granular in the sense that users cannot give or withdraw consent on an individual cookie basis.

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: No, the policy does not provide specific, granular, and separate consent for each type of cookie (Article 7(4) GDPR). Instead, it groups them into two categories.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can save their preference settings or close the Privacy Settings popup. However, it is unclear whether this setting will persist across sessions.
     - Granular Consent: No, as mentioned above, the policy does not allow for separate consent for each type of cookie.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy briefly explains the purpose of each category of cookies (Article 13 GDPR).
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, the policy mentions that third-party cookies may be used (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR – legitimate interest), but it lacks clarity regarding the identities of these third parties and the nature of the data shared.

  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, the policy does not define consent in accordance with the GDPR definition (Article 4(11)). Instead, it only provides a general description of the cookies' purposes without explicitly stating that users are granting their consent to the processing of their personal data.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Non-Compliant, the policy does not meet the GDPR requirements for explicit, granular, and separate consent. Instead, it provides a general notice with the option to accept all cookies or save custom settings.

  4. Final Justification: The cookie policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it offers some transparency regarding the use of cookies and provides a mechanism to manage preference settings, but it falls short in obtaining explicit, granular, and separate consent for each category of cookie.

     - Explicit Consent: Yes (the user is asked to accept all cookies or manage preferences)
       - Legal Basis: Legitimate Interest (Article 6(1)(f)) and Consent (Article 6(1)(a)) as the use of cookies can be necessary for providing the service and personalized advertising, but also requires explicit consent due to their intrusive nature.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes (the user can manage cookie preferences at any time)
       - Legal Justification: This mechanism allows users to withdraw their consent, which is a requirement under GDPR Article 7(3).
     - Granular Consent: Partially (the user can choose between accepting all cookies or rejecting them all, but not individual cookies)
       - Justification: While the user can select categories of cookies, they cannot make choices about specific cookies within those categories. This lacks granularity and may not meet the requirement for specific, informed consent under GDPR Article 7(2)(a).
     - Data Transparency: Yes (the policy explains the purpose of cookie usage, data transfers, and provides a link to the Privacy Policy)
       - Justification: The user is informed about the purposes of cookie usage, which is essential for transparency under GDPR Article 13.
  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Compliant
       - Reason: The policy uses a clear and affirmative action to obtain consent, which aligns with the GDPR definition of consent as freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant
       - Reason: Although explicit consent is obtained, the user lacks granular control over individual cookies, which may not meet the requirement for specific and informed consent under GDPR Article 7(2)(a).
  4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR as it obtains explicit consent but lacks granularity in cookie preference management, potentially compromising the specificity and transparency of the user's consent.
  5. Suggested Enhancements: To meet legal requirements more fully, consider implementing a system that allows users to accept or refuse individual cookies within each category. This would provide greater granularity and ensure that users have informed consent in line with GDPR Article 7(2)(a). Additionally, clarify the types of cookies used by Symrise and their specific purposes. This will improve transparency under GDPR Article 13."

     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can revoke their consent with effect for the future.
     - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, as granularity could be improved by providing separate consents for different categories of cookies and clearly explaining the legal basis for each category.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, further information on processing, companies involved, third-party providers and adjusting purposes can be found in a linked document. However, more detailed information about each type of cookie should be provided directly within this policy.

  4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it provides a mechanism for withdrawal of consent and some level of transparency about data processing activities, but it falls short in terms of providing a granular consent mechanism and failing to comply with the strict definition of consent as required by GDPR Article 4(11).

   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] While the user is provided with an option to give consent, the information provided about the processing activities may not be concise, explicit, and transparent enough to meet the requirements of Article 7(4).

4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements as it provides some transparency about data processing activities and offers the user an option to give or withdraw their consent. However, it falls short in providing concise and explicit information about these activities, which is crucial for informed consent under GDPR.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Improve transparency by providing clearer and more concise explanations of data processing activities, including purposes, legal bases, and third-party involvement.
   - Ensure that the ""Accept all"" option includes all legally required information about data processing activities and third-party involvement to meet the GDPR's explicit consent requirement.
   - Consider providing separate options for essential cookies and non-essential cookies in the cookie banner, as selecting ""Only essential"" currently only disables non-essential cookies but still allows data processing activities for personalized advertising and analytics."

   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant. The policy provides information about the purposes and functions for which consent is given, as well as the user's right to withdraw consent at any time.

4. Final Justification:
The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements due to its granular approach to seeking user consent for various purposes and functions of data processing. However, it lacks clarity on certain aspects such as the specific legal basis for partner data processing within the IAB TCF.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clarify the specific legal basis for partner data processing within the IAB TCF.
   - Provide more concise and user-friendly language to make it easier for users to understand their options and the implications of giving consent.

Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR as it provides some transparency regarding data processing activities, offers a mechanism to withdraw consent, and seeks explicit consent from users. However, it fails to meet the GDPR standard for granular consent which requires separate consent for each purpose.
  5. Suggested Enhancements: To achieve full compliance with GDPR, the cookie policy should offer a more granular approach to obtaining user consent by allowing users to select individual cookies or specific purposes rather than just categories. Additionally, providing clear and concise information about the data processing activities of third-party providers may help improve transparency."

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, with the consent granted by the user when clicking ""Accept All"". The legal basis is consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR).
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can withdraw their consent at any time by changing their cookie settings in the Cookies Settings.
     - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, as the policy provides options to accept or reject all cookies but does not allow for granular selection of individual cookies.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, information about the purpose of each type of cookie is provided, although it could be more explicit and detailed in some cases.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, with clarity level: The policy mentions that cookies are used for marketing purposes, which may involve third-party data handling.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the definition provided in the cookie policy does not fully align with the GDPR's consent definition (Article 4(11)), which specifies that consent must be ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous"".
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as users are provided with a clear and distinct means to accept or reject cookies but there is no evidence of an easy-to-understand and accessible privacy statement at the time of asking for consent.

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it allows users to make a choice regarding the storage of cookies on their device, provides a mechanism for withdrawing consent, and offers some transparency about the purpose of each type of cookie. However, it fails to fully comply with GDPR requirements by not offering granular control over individual cookies, not providing an easy-to-understand privacy statement at the time of asking for consent, and not meeting the strict definition of consent as required by Article 4(11).

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Offer granular control over individual cookies in the cookie settings.
   - Provide a clear, easy-to-understand privacy statement at the time of asking for user consent.
   - Ensure that the definition and purpose of consent provided align with the GDPR's requirements."

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes (for marketing and performance cookies) / No (for strictly necessary cookies), Legal Basis for strictly necessary cookies is the legitimate interest of Knorr-Bremse in the operation of the website, while consent is required for marketing and performance cookies.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can manage their cookie preferences and save the settings by clicking on ""Confirm my selection"" or ""Reject optional cookies"".
     - Granular Consent: Yes, users are given the option to manage their cookie preferences in individual categories.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides information about the types of cookies used (strictly necessary, performance, and marketing) and their purposes. However, more details could be provided about third-party data handling.
  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the policy does not clearly state that consent must be ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous"". The consent for strictly necessary cookies is not based on user choice but rather a default configuration.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant, as users are provided with clear and comprehensive information about the processing of their personal data via cookies, and they have the option to withdraw their consent.
  4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements as it provides some transparency about the use of cookies, offers a withdrawal mechanism, and allows users to manage their cookie preferences. However, it is not fully compliant because it does not meet all the conditions for consent as defined in Article 4(11), particularly regarding freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous consent for strictly necessary cookies.
  5. Suggested Enhancements:
    - Clarify the legal basis for using strictly necessary cookies by obtaining explicit, freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous consent from users.
    - Provide more detailed information about third-party data handling in the cookie policy.
    - Offer an easy way to access and update cookie preferences at any time during the user's visit to the website.

2. Legal Justification:
   - Explicit Consent: Yes, the user is provided with an option to accept or reject cookies and given the opportunity to adjust settings at any time. However, it could be argued that explicit consent for third-party data handling (such as Google Analytics) may not always be obtained since the default setting allows for the collection of such data.
   - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can withdraw their consent by modifying cookie settings at any time.
   - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, granular control is provided over categories (Comfort, Statistics / Range Measurement, Necessary) but not all individual cookies within these categories.
   - Data Transparency: Yes, some information about the purpose of data processing, data recipients, and potential risks associated with third-party data handling is provided.
   - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, third-party services such as Google Analytics are used, but clarity level could be improved to ensure that users understand the implications of accepting cookies for statistical purposes, particularly regarding data transfer to the USA.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, the cookie policy does not explicitly state that consent is specific, informed, and unambiguous. While users are provided with options, they may not fully understand the implications of their choices.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as explicit and granular consent is not always obtained for third-party data handling. Additionally, it could be argued that the information provided about the purpose of processing and potential risks may not be easily accessible or understandable for all users.

4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements due to the provision of cookie settings and a withdrawal mechanism. However, it falls short in obtaining explicit and granular consent for third-party data handling, as well as providing clear and easily understandable information about the implications of accepting cookies.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly state that consent is specific, informed, and unambiguous.
   - Ensure that granular control over individual cookies within each category is provided.
   - Improve transparency by providing more detailed information about the purpose of data processing, data recipients, and potential risks associated with third-party data handling in a user-friendly manner.

     - Granular Consent: Yes, the user can select which types of cookies they allow or disallow.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides some information about the purpose and third-party involved in data processing, but more detail is required to meet full transparency requirements under GDPR.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, with some clarity as the user is informed that their data will be shared with social media, advertising, and analytics partners. However, there's no information about the specific third parties involved or the purpose of sharing data with them.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Compliant, as the policy defines consent in line with the GDPR definition.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Non-compliant, as the information provided is not sufficiently clear, specific, and concise to allow the data subject to easily understand and freely give their consent.

4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR regulations regarding cookie consent due to the active user acceptance, withdrawal mechanism, and granular consent options. However, it falls short in providing adequate transparency about the third parties involved in data processing and not meeting the requirements for clear and concise information as set out in Article 7.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Improve transparency by listing the specific third-party providers that will process users' personal data, providing more detailed descriptions of the purposes for which their data will be used, and offering links to each provider's privacy policy.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Compliant, as the policy describes the nature, purpose, and recipients of the processing, and specifies that consent is required for certain types of cookies.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as while users are informed about their options and provided with a withdrawal mechanism, there's no clear mention of a legal basis other than consent for the use of non-essential cookies.

4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR because it provides some information about cookies and allows users to manage their preferences. However, it falls short by not explicitly stating a legal basis for processing certain types of cookies (other than those necessary for the website's functionality). This could be problematic if the use of non-essential cookies is based on legitimate interest instead of consent.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clearly state the legal basis for processing cookies that are not strictly necessary for the website's functionality. This could be a legitimate interest or another applicable GDPR ground.
   - Ensure all third-party data handlers have their data handling practices clearly disclosed and consider using providers that offer GDPR-compliant services.

     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, consent can be revoked at any time via the Privacy Settings at the bottom of the website.
     - Granular Consent: Partially compliant, while users can customize their preferences, the policy does not provide clear granularity regarding which specific cookies are being used for each purpose (e.g., storage of or access to information on a device).
     - Data Transparency: Yes, data processing purposes and providers are listed, but there is no explicit disclosure of the personal data categories being processed.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, third-party providers are named, however, clarity could be improved by specifying the purpose for which each provider processes the data.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, the policy does not explicitly mention that consent must be ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous.""
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant, the website provides clear information about the processing activities and the data subjects' rights to withdraw consent. However, it could be more explicit about providing clear and concise information in an intelligible and easily accessible form.

     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can revoke their consent at any time, but the functionality to do so is not explicitly shown in the cookie policy text provided.
     - Granular Consent: No, as the policy does not provide separate options for each purpose of data processing (Analytics, Marketing, etc.).
     - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides some information about the types of cookies used and the purposes for which they are processed. However, it could be more transparent about third-party service providers involved in data processing.

     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant. The policy does provide a mechanism for obtaining user consent, but it is not specific enough as it bundles multiple purposes together without allowing users to give granular consent (Article 7(4)).
  4. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR because it obtains some form of user consent and provides a way to withdraw that consent. However, the policy falls short in ensuring specific and informed consent as well as being transparent about third-party data handling.

     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can change their selection at any time and revoke consent with effect for the future as stated under ""Cookie Settings"".
     - Granular Consent: Partially compliant, although the policy provides categories for cookies, it does not clearly explain each category's purpose or specify which specific cookies are used within each category.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, some information about cookie usage and data transfers is provided under ""More Information"" and ""Cookie Preferences"". However, a clear and concise explanation of each category of cookie and the specific purposes for which they are used should be given to users in a more accessible manner.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but clarity level could be improved. The list of data processing partners and services suggests third-party involvement, but it does not specify whether these parties have access to personal data or how they use the collected data.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Partially compliant. The policy seeks user consent for the use of cookies and similar technologies, but it does not provide a clear explanation of what ""consent"" means in this context. A definition should be included that aligns with the GDPR's definition.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially compliant. Although users are given the option to accept or decline cookies, the information provided about each category of cookie is not easily understandable or specific enough to meet the requirements for informed consent.

4. Final Justification: The policy partially meets GDPR requirements regarding cookie usage and user consent. However, it falls short in providing a clear and concise explanation of each category of cookie and their purposes, as well as ensuring transparency about third-party data handling and compliance with the definition of consent under Article 4(11).

     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can adjust their preferences at any time.
     - Granular Consent: Partially Compliant, as it provides options to accept all processing purposes, activate only necessary technologies, or customize preferences, but the level of granularity may not be sufficient under GDPR standards (Article 7(4)).

  3. Compliance with Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant, as the policy does not clearly state that consent is ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous,"" which is a requirement under this article.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant, as users are provided with clear and comprehensive information about the processing activities and can withdraw their consent at any time.
  4. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements due to its lack of specificity in obtaining explicit consent and providing granular options for managing cookies. The primary reason behind this classification is that while users are informed about data processing, they do not have a complete understanding of the legal basis for each activity and cannot easily manage their preferences at a detailed level.

  2. Legal Justification:
     - Explicit Consent: Yes, users are required to actively click ""OK"" for cookies to be used, and the consent is specific (granular). The legal basis is legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR) since the use of cookies is necessary to provide an online service.
     - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, users can change or revoke their consent at any time in the Privacy Information section.
     - Granular Consent: Yes, users are presented with four different categories of cookies (Necessary, Preference, Statistics, and Marketing) and can choose which ones to allow.
     - Data Transparency: Yes, users are informed about the types of cookies used, their purposes, and how they can change or revoke their consent.
     - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes (Marketing Cookies), but there's no clarity on whether these third parties have their own privacy policies or whether data is shared with other third parties.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Partially Compliant, as the definition provided in the Cookie Policy does not specifically state that consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, since users are required to actively opt-in to most types of cookies, but there's no indication that they have the option to withdraw their consent without undue difficulty.

4. Final Justification: The Cookie Policy is partially compliant with GDPR requirements because it provides information about cookies and allows users to give and withdraw their consent for certain cookie categories. However, it falls short in defining consent clearly according to Article 4(11) and ensuring that users can easily withdraw their consent without difficulty.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Clarify the definition of consent in line with Article 4(11) GDPR by stating that consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.
   - Simplify the withdrawal mechanism for cookies by providing a clear option to revoke consent on the cookie banner or within the Privacy Information section without requiring users to send an email to the support team.
   - Clearly state whether third-party providers have their own privacy policies and whether data is shared with other third parties when using Marketing Cookies. If so, provide links to these policies for transparency.

2. Legal Justification:
   - Explicit Consent: Yes, but the consent is bundled (i.e., users cannot give consent for individual purposes), which may not fully meet the GDPR requirements for granularity. The legal basis for processing is Article 6(1)(a) - Consent of the data subject.
   - Withdrawal Mechanism: Yes, but it could be improved as the withdrawal mechanism is only accessible after the user has given consent (either by clicking ""Allow all"" or ""Only necessary allow""). This goes against the GDPR principle that consent should be as easy to withdraw as it was to give.
   - Granular Consent: No, as users cannot give separate consents for different purposes (e.g., statistics and marketing).
   - Data Transparency: Yes, the policy provides sufficient information about the data processed, purposes, and providers. However, the transparency could be improved by providing more detailed explanations for each purpose.
   - Third-Party Data Handling: Yes, but the clarity level could be improved as there is no mention of whether third parties have access to personal data for their own purposes or if they act as processors only.

3. Compliance with Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Non-Compliant] The definition of consent provided in the policy does not meet the GDPR requirements for being ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous"". As users cannot select individual purposes, their consent may not be specific enough.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] The policy provides information about the processing of personal data, but it does not ensure that the user's consent is separate from other terms and conditions. This could lead to confusion and potential non-compliance with GDPR.

4. Final Justification:
   The cookie policy is partially compliant because it provides transparency regarding the data processed, purposes, and providers but fails to meet the GDPR requirements for explicit and granular consent. The main issue lies in the bundling of consent, making it difficult for users to give and withdraw their consent separately for each purpose.

5. Suggested Enhancements:
   - Unbundle the consent options so that users can explicitly agree or disagree to individual purposes (statistics, marketing, etc.).
   - Provide more detailed explanations for each processing purpose.
   - Simplify the withdrawal mechanism by allowing users to revoke their consent at any time without requiring initial consent first.
   - Clarify the relationship between the data controller and third-party providers regarding data access and purposes."

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented: Yes, users are required to actively accept cookies by clicking on the ""accept all"" button, which indicates clear and specific consent. However, technical cookies do not require user consent, as per the policy text. This may lead to ambiguity since it's unclear if users can refuse these non-essential cookies without disabling the entire site functionality.
     - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism: Users can withdraw their consent by accessing the settings option and modifying their cookie preferences. However, it should be noted that technical cookies cannot be disabled, which may not meet the GDPR requirement for easy withdrawal of consent since essential functionalities are affected when declining non-essential cookies.
  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain: Users can choose specific categories of cookies (Technical, Audience Measurement, Performance, Functional, Marketing) but cannot select individual cookies within those categories. This could be seen as an area for improvement to achieve full compliance with GDPR.
     - Is granular control over cookies offered? The policy provides some level of granular control since users can choose specific categories of cookies. However, the inability to opt-out from technical cookies individually might constitute a shortcoming under GDPR's requirements for granularity.
  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? Yes, the policy indicates that data may be shared with third parties outside the EEA without an adequate level of protection under data protection law, but it could be more explicitly stated to ensure clarity for users.
     - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? The purpose of data processing is clearly stated in the policy text, although it may benefit from further clarification regarding specific purposes for individual categories of cookies (e.g., how audience measurement cookies contribute to site performance).
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] - The policy complies with Article 4(11), as it uses clear and affirmative action to obtain user consent for the processing of personal data. However, ambiguity regarding technical cookies may lead to potential non-compliance.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] - The policy appears to comply with Article 7, as it provides a clear and concise statement of the purposes for processing personal data. However, similar concerns about technical cookies may imply partial non-compliance in this area too.
  6. Critical Analysis:
     - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements: The primary concern with this cookie policy is the ambiguity regarding the refusal of technical cookies, which are considered essential for site functionality. Additionally, more explicit disclosure and explanation could be provided about data sharing with third parties and specific purposes for each category of cookies.
  7. Final Justification: The classification of ""Partially Compliant"" was chosen because while the policy meets many GDPR requirements, it still needs improvement regarding clarity in user choices and transparency around technical cookies.
  8. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance GDPR compliance, the following practical steps could be implemented:
     - Clarify the ability for users to refuse non-essential cookies without affecting site functionality.
     - Provide more detailed explanations of data sharing with third parties and specific purposes for each category of cookies.
     - Ensure that granular control over individual cookies is offered within each category to meet GDPR requirements for user choice and consent."
verbose_compliance,compliant,compliant-1.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Classification: Partially Compliant - The policy provides information about cookies, their types, and the option to give or withdraw consent. However, it does not offer granular control over specific cookie types.

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented. [Compliant] - The policy clearly presents the request for consent for marketing cookies and statistical cookies, and users are required to give their consent before these cookies are activated.
   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism. [Compliant] - Users can adjust their consent at any time by clicking on ""Cookie Settings"" in the website footer, which allows them to modify or revoke their consent.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. [Non-Compliant] - The policy does not offer granular control over individual cookie types; instead, it provides two options: ""Allow All Cookies"" or ""Continue with Essential Cookies.""
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? [Non-Compliant] - As explained above, the policy does not provide granular control over specific cookie types.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? [Compliant] - The policy explains that personal data may be used for both personalized and non-personalized advertising, and lists the various third-party services that use cookies on the website.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? [Partially Compliant] - While the purpose of using cookies is described, it could be made clearer and more concise to facilitate understanding for all users.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Non-Compliant] - The policy does not offer granular control over individual cookie types, which goes against the GDPR requirement for explicit and informed consent.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] - Although users are given the option to give or withdraw their consent, they are not offered granular control over specific cookie types, which conflicts with the GDPR requirement for explicit and informed consent.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. As mentioned above, the lack of granular control over specific cookie types is a significant issue that may compromise compliance with the GDPR. Additionally, while the purpose of using cookies is explained, it could be made clearer and more concise to facilitate understanding for all users.

7. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR because it provides information about cookies, offers a mechanism for consent and withdrawal, and lists third-party services that use cookies on the website. However, it fails to offer granular control over specific cookie types, which may compromise compliance with the GDPR requirement for explicit and informed consent.

8. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance GDPR compliance, consider offering users a more granular control over individual cookie types. Additionally, make an effort to clarify and simplify the language used in the policy to ensure that all users can understand the purpose of using cookies easily."

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented: Yes, users are explicitly informed about the usage of cookies and asked to give consent upon their first visit. However, clicking ""Accept & Close"" does not provide clear evidence of consent beyond the simple action itself. A more explicit method could be used for a stronger compliance posture (e.g., pre-checked checkbox with an opt-out option).
     - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism: Users can manage their preferences at any time by clicking on ""Cookie Settings"" and adjusting their options, which provides some level of control over consent. However, it might be more user-friendly to provide an explicit 'Withdraw Consent' button or option within this settings page for improved clarity.
  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain: Yes, users can select specific categories of cookies they want to allow by choosing from ""Essential"", ""Functional"", ""Marketing"" options within the Cookie Settings. This level of granularity is compliant with GDPR requirements.
     - Is granular control over cookies offered?: Yes, the tool allows users to manage their preferences for each category, providing a high degree of control over cookies that are processed on their device.
  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? : The policy explains which third-party services are being used (Essential, Functional, Marketing) but does not provide much detail about the nature of data processing or how it is shared specifically. A more detailed description could help to meet GDPR requirements better.
     - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? : The policy discloses the general purposes (e.g., website performance, interest-based ads), but it could benefit from a more specific and user-friendly explanation for improved transparency.
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]: Partially Compliant – The policy does provide users with the option to accept or refuse cookies, but it lacks a clear and affirmative action to demonstrate explicit consent. This could be addressed by using pre-checked checkboxes or similar features that require an explicit opt-out option for better compliance with Article 4(11).
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]: Partially Compliant – The policy discloses the use of cookies, explains users' rights to withdraw consent and offers granular control over cookie types. However, it could improve by providing a clearer and more explicit method for obtaining and recording consent in line with Article 7 requirements.
  6. Critical Analysis:
     - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements: Although the policy does offer some level of compliance, it falls short in certain critical aspects such as providing a clear and affirmative method for obtaining and recording consent, offering more detailed information on data sharing with third parties, and ensuring transparency about the nature of data processing.
  7. Final Justification:
     - Clearly explain why the classification was chosen: The policy partially meets GDPR requirements in terms of disclosure and control over cookies but does not fully comply with the spirit of explicit consent, detailed information on data sharing, and complete transparency about data processing purposes as required by Article 4(11) and 7.
  8. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Practical steps to enhance GDPR compliance:
       a) Provide a clear and affirmative method for obtaining and recording user consent (e.g., pre-checked checkboxes with an opt-out option).
       b) Offer more detailed information about data sharing with third parties and the nature of data processing.
       c) Improve transparency by using simple, user-friendly language to explain the purpose of data collection and processing in the policy."

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented: Yes, the policy provides an option to accept or reject cookies, which can be considered as explicit consent. It also mentions the Art. 49 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a GDPR for non-essential cookies usage in the USA.
     - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism: Yes, users can withdraw their consent at any time by managing cookie settings or revoking their consent via the Cookie Policy link.
  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain: Yes, users have the option to select individual non-essential cookies they want to accept or decline in the Cookie Settings.
     - Is granular control over cookies offered? Yes, users can manage their cookie preferences individually based on the four categories provided.
  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? Yes, the policy mentions that data may be processed in the USA for non-essential cookies usage.
     - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? Yes, the purpose of using cookies is clearly stated, but it might be improved by providing more specific information about each cookie category (e.g., what performance or functional cookies are used for).
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant] The policy provides a mechanism for obtaining explicit consent from users, which aligns with the GDPR definition of consent in Article 4(11).
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] Although the policy allows users to withdraw their consent at any time, it does not provide clear and affirmative action from the user to opt-in. However, the mention of Art. 49 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a GDPR for non-essential cookies usage in the USA shows an understanding of the conditions required for valid consent under Article 7.
  6. Critical Analysis:
     - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements: The policy does not explicitly provide a clear, affirmative action for users to opt-in to non-essential cookies usage (Article 4(11) requires that consent should be ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous""). Additionally, the explanation of data processing purposes could be more detailed to ensure transparency.
  7. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR requirements due to the absence of a clear, affirmative action for opting-in to non-essential cookies usage and insufficiently detailed explanations of data processing purposes.
  8. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Make sure to offer a clear, affirmative action for users to opt-in to non-essential cookies usage (e.g., by providing an ""Accept All Cookies"" option with a separate checkbox for non-essential cookies).
     - Enhance the explanation of data processing purposes by providing more specific information about each cookie category, such as what performance or functional cookies are used for."
verbose_compliance,compliant,compliant-12.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Classification: Partially Compliant

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Explicit consent is given through the options provided to users (Accept All, Reject All, Manage settings). The mechanism for giving consent is clear and easy to understand.
   - Users can easily withdraw their consent by changing their cookie preferences at any time using the ""Manage settings"" option.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types (Functional Cookies, Advertising Cookies). However, Required Cookies (essential for basic website functionality) are always active and cannot be deselected.
   - While granular control over cookies is offered, the restriction of some cookies as 'Required' may not meet the full expectation of granularity under GDPR.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Data sharing with third parties for advertising purposes is disclosed clearly. However, the purpose of data processing could be more explicitly stated to make it more transparent and understandable.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant] - The policy explains what kind of consent is required for each category of cookie, and users can easily give or withdraw their consent, meeting the definition of GDPR consent.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] - Although users are given a choice and can easily give or withdraw consent, the restrictions on some cookies as 'Required' may not fully comply with GDPR, which emphasizes that consent should be specific, informed, and freely given.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - While the policy provides an option to choose specific cookie types, the requirement of certain cookies as 'Required' could potentially infringe on users' rights to freely give their consent.

7. Final Justification:
   - The policy is partially compliant because it offers a choice for users to select cookie preferences and allows easy withdrawal of consent, but the restriction of some cookies as 'Required' may not fully meet GDPR requirements.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To enhance GDPR compliance, consider providing a clear rationale for why certain cookies are deemed 'Required'. Also, offer users the option to fully reject any type of cookie if they wish, rather than limiting the ability to deselect only some categories."
verbose_compliance,compliant,compliant-13.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Classification: Partially Compliant

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Explicit consent is given through the options presented to users upon their first visit to the website (the ""Settings,"" ""Only Required,"" and ""Accept All"" buttons). Users must actively choose an option, demonstrating explicit consent.
   - Users can easily withdraw consent by changing their cookie preferences at any time using the ""Settings"" button.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types (essential, analytics, marketing) but cannot deselect third-party cookies or individually choose each partner.
   - Users have granular control over some cookie types but not all, as there is no option to customize preferences at an individual cookie level.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed clearly in the policy (under ""Our partners also use these technologies"").
   - The purpose of data processing is transparent, but it may not be understandable to all users due to technical jargon and lack of clear explanation of the benefits or potential drawbacks.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially Compliant] The policy provides a clear description of what is covered by cookies and similar technologies, but users do not have the option to explicitly agree to each individual cookie or partner, which could be seen as less explicit consent.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant] Users are given clear and specific information about the processing activities carried out with their data, the identity of the data controller, and their right to withdraw consent at any time.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - The policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements regarding granularity since users cannot select individual cookies or partners. This could be seen as a lack of user control over their personal data.

7. Final Justification:
   - The policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it provides clear information about the use of cookies and offers options for users to manage their consent. However, it does not meet the strict requirement for explicit consent regarding each individual cookie or partner.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To enhance GDPR compliance, consider allowing users to select specific cookies or partners they accept rather than offering broad categories like ""Analytics"" and ""Marketing."" This would provide a more granular level of control over personal data. Additionally, consider simplifying the language used in the policy to make it more understandable for all users."
verbose_compliance,compliant,compliant-14.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented: The policy presents an ""explicit"" choice for users to accept or reject cookies, which is a good start as users can actively opt-in or opt-out of cookie usage. However, the default option (Reject All) does not technically constitute 'active' consent since users don't have to take any action beyond choosing this preselected option.
     - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism: Users can change their preferences at any time by clicking on ""Cookie Settings."" This allows them to customize and manage their consent, thus enabling withdrawal of consent. However, it would be better practice to automatically revert to the default 'Reject All' setting when a user chooses to withdraw consent, instead of leaving potentially unwanted cookies active until the user takes further action.
  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain: Users can select or deselect specific cookie categories like Analysis Cookies, Marketing & Social Networks, and Personal Offers. This offers some granular control over cookies but doesn't fully meet the standard of offering granular control as users are still presented with a binary choice for each category (accept/decline).
     - Is granular control over cookies offered? Users can manage their consent for different categories but cannot control specific cookies within those categories, making it less granular than required.
  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly?: Yes, the policy explains that data may be shared with partners and social networks for marketing and analysis purposes. However, more details on who these specific partners are would help improve transparency.
     - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? Yes, users are informed about the purpose of using cookies for marketing, analysis, and website optimization.
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant] The policy presents a clear choice between accepting or rejecting all cookies, which constitutes ""clear and affirmative action"" as defined in Article 4(11). However, the preselected 'Reject All' option may be problematic.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] Users are given clear information about how their data will be used and have the opportunity to give consent, but the default option of 'Reject All' does not necessarily constitute an active choice as required by GDPR. Additionally, the policy does not explicitly explain that consent can be withdrawn at any time.
  6. Critical Analysis: The policy fails to meet the GDPR requirement for a truly active and informed consent since users are presented with a preselected 'Reject All' option. Users may accidentally accept or reject cookie categories without fully understanding their implications, undermining the principle of transparency.
  7. Final Justification: The classification was chosen as the policy presents users with options to accept or decline cookies, but it does not meet the GDPR standard for an active and informed consent due to the preselected 'Reject All' option and lack of clear explanation about the withdrawal mechanism.
  8. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance compliance with GDPR, Vodafone should modify its Cookie Policy by:
     - Removing the preselected 'Reject All' option, forcing users to make an active choice between accepting all cookies or only necessary cookies.
     - Offering granular control over specific cookies within each category (e.g., individual tracking cookies).
     - Explicitly stating that users can easily withdraw consent at any time and that the default setting will revert to 'Reject All' when they choose to do so.
     - Providing more detailed information about data sharing partners and their roles in the cookie process."

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain: Yes, users are provided with granular control over cookies by allowing them to choose specific cookie types in the ""Cookie Settings.""
   - Is granular control over cookies offered?: Yes, the policy offers granular control over cookies as users can manage their preferences for each category of cookies (Strictly Necessary, Performance, Functional, and Targeting).

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? The policy mentions the use of cookies for ""personalized advertising and remarketing"" which could involve third-party data sharing, but there is no specific disclosure about the identity of these third parties.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable?: Yes, the purpose of using cookies (to ensure users have a better experience on the website) and each category of cookies' role in this (enabling social media interactions, personalized messages, analytics for website performance) is explained clearly.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] - The policy appears to comply with this article as it presents clear and specific information about the use of cookies, provides granular control over cookies, and offers users a choice to accept or reject them.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] - The policy complies with Article 7 as it presents clear and specific information about the use of cookies, provides granular control over cookies, offers users a choice to accept or reject them, and allows users to withdraw their consent easily.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements: While the policy generally meets the requirements of GDPR in terms of providing clear information about cookies and offering granular control over them, it could improve by disclosing third-party identities involved in data sharing. This transparency is essential for users to make informed decisions about their privacy.

7. Final Justification: The classification is Partially Compliant because the policy complies with most GDPR requirements but could be improved by disclosing third-party identities involved in data sharing.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To enhance GDPR compliance, consider updating the cookie policy to include the names of any third parties that may have access to user data, along with their contact information and a link to their own privacy policies. This will help users make more informed decisions about their privacy and strengthen the overall compliance of the policy."
verbose_compliance,compliant,compliant-16.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Classification: Partially Compliant

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:

     - Yes, the purposes of data processing are presented in a clear and understandable manner for each category of cookies.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
     - The policy complies with Article 4(11) as it defines consent as ""any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.""

   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
     - The policy complies with Article 7 as it provides clear information about which cookies are used, why they are needed, and how users can manage their cookie preferences. It also ensures that the user's consent is specific, informed, and easy to withdraw.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements.
     - Although the policy provides granular control over cookies, it does not provide an easily accessible way for users to view or modify their choices after they have been made (Article 7(5) requirement). The policy also lacks a detailed explanation of the legal basis for data processing in the case of essential cookies, which may be required under GDPR.

7. Final Justification:
   - The classification is 'Partially Compliant' because although the policy provides explicit consent and granular control over cookies, it could improve by offering a more user-friendly way to view and modify cookie choices and providing a detailed explanation of the legal basis for data processing in the case of essential cookies.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Implement a simple interface allowing users to easily review and manage their cookie preferences at any time.
   - Clearly state the legal basis for data processing in the case of essential cookies, and ensure that this information is accessible to users."

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented. (Compliant) The policy clearly informs users that they must give consent to use cookies, and it presents the types of cookies and their purposes.
     - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism. (Partially Compliant) Users can choose to ""Accept Cookies,"" ""Accept Only Necessary,"" or go to Cookie Settings to customize preferences, which allows them to change or withdraw their consent. However, it lacks a simple and straightforward way to withdraw consent without navigating away from the initial cookie banner.
  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. (Partially Compliant) Users can choose between three options, allowing them to opt for necessary cookies only or accept all cookies. However, they cannot explicitly select functional or targeting cookies.
     - Is granular control over cookies offered? (Non-Compliant) The policy lacks the ability for users to make granular choices about each type of cookie and its specific use.
  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? (Partially Compliant) The policy mentions that targeting cookies track interests and browsing behavior for targeted advertising, which is shared with third parties. However, it does not explicitly state the identities of these third parties or their purposes for processing the data.
     - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? (Partially Compliant) The policy briefly explains the purposes of each type of cookie but lacks clarity about how the data will be used by third parties.
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant] The policy explicitly states that users must give consent to use cookies, and it clearly explains the purposes of each type of cookie.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Non-Compliant] The policy does not provide a straightforward way for users to easily withdraw their consent without navigating away from the initial cookie banner, which may violate the requirement for clear and easily accessible options to withdraw consent.
  6. Critical Analysis:
     - The policy lacks granular control over cookies, making it difficult for users to understand exactly what data is being collected and shared with third parties. Additionally, users cannot explicitly consent to functional or targeting cookies; they can only accept all of them or opt for necessary cookies only. Lastly, the withdrawal mechanism for consent could be more straightforward to ensure compliance with Article 7 requirements.
  7. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it informs users about the use of cookies and presents options for managing their consent. However, it fails to meet GDPR requirements due to the lack of granular control over cookies and a clear and easily accessible withdrawal mechanism for consent.
  8. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance GDPR compliance, the policy should provide more detailed information about data sharing with third parties, offer granular control over cookie preferences, and implement an easy-to-use withdrawal mechanism for consent that does not require users to navigate away from the initial cookie banner. Additionally, consider incorporating a link to your Privacy Statement within the Cookie Policy for clarity and transparency."
verbose_compliance,compliant,compliant-18.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Classification: Partially Compliant

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented. The policy provides an opportunity to give explicit consent by presenting different cookie categories with the option to accept or decline them. However, the ""Accept All"" option grants full consent without providing a clear understanding of each category and its purpose, which may be seen as non-compliant with GDPR's requirement for informed consent.
   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism. Users can manage their preferences at any time by clicking on the ""Settings"" button or choosing the ""Only Technically Necessary"" option, which allows only essential cookies. These settings can be updated and saved as needed.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. Users are given two options other than accepting all cookies: ""Only Technically Necessary"" and ""Settings."" The first option limits the use of cookies to only essential ones, while the second provides granular control over various categories like performance, analytics, marketing, and personalization.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? Yes, users can configure their preferences by selecting specific categories in the ""Settings"" section.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? The policy mentions data sharing with selected partners like Google for marketing purposes. However, more detailed information about third-party recipients, data retention periods, and the nature of the data shared would be helpful to ensure full transparency.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? The policy provides some explanation for each cookie category but could benefit from a clearer, easily understandable description of the purposes behind the data processing.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy presents an opportunity for users to give explicit consent, but the ""Accept All"" option may not fully meet GDPR requirements because it does not provide a clear understanding of each category and its purpose.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy provides a clear notice about cookie use, as well as the opportunity to give consent. However, the 'Accept All' option may not fully meet GDPR requirements due to its lack of specificity regarding each category and its purpose.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. The current implementation may not fully comply with GDPR due to the 'Accept All' option, which does not provide enough detail about each cookie category and its purpose. Additionally, more detailed information about data sharing with third parties would be beneficial for ensuring transparency.

7. Final Justification:
   - The classification of 'Partially Compliant' reflects that while users have the opportunity to give explicit consent and can manage their preferences, the 'Accept All' option does not fully meet GDPR requirements regarding specificity in consent.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To enhance GDPR compliance, consider revising the 'Accept All' option to provide a clearer explanation of each cookie category and its purpose. Also, offer more detailed information about data sharing with third parties to ensure transparency."

   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy appears to comply with this article, as the consent mechanism provided is based on clear and affirmative actions by the user.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy seems compliant with this article, as it provides information about the use of cookies, explains the purpose of processing, and offers a choice to users regarding their consent.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - One potential issue is the requirement under GDPR that users should be informed about the specific storage duration or expiry period of each cookie type. Although the policy does not provide this information explicitly, the ""Allow necessary only"" option can be considered as implying that these cookies are temporary and essential for website functionality.
   - Additionally, it may be beneficial to provide more detailed explanations about the data collection, processing, and sharing practices in simpler language to enhance user understanding and transparency.

7. Final Justification:
   - The policy is classified as Partially Compliant because, while it offers explicit consent options and a clear mechanism for withdrawal, it could benefit from additional information regarding cookie expiration periods and more detailed explanations about data processing practices.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Provide explicit information about the storage duration or expiry period of each cookie type.
   - Simplify language used to explain data collection, processing, and sharing practices for improved user understanding and transparency."

However, it does not explicitly link the use of cookies to GDPR requirements, does not provide a clear withdrawal mechanism, and does not offer granular control over cookies.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Practical steps to enhance GDPR compliance:
  1. Explicitly mention that the use of cookies is subject to GDPR requirements.
  2. Provide a clear, easy-to-use mechanism for users to withdraw their consent without ambiguity or undue difficulty.
  3. Offer granular control over cookies by allowing users to select specific advertising cookies and data sources.

     - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types through the offered ""More"" option, where they can configure individual privacy preferences. This meets the granular control requirement.
  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed clearly in the policy by listing all the third-party services using cookies. However, a more detailed explanation of how data will be used and shared may further improve transparency.
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy complies with this article as it provides clear information about the processing activities carried out using cookies, and users have the freedom to give or withdraw their consent at any time.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy partially complies with this article, as it explains the nature of the processing operation, but it could be improved by providing more detailed information about how consent will be obtained and how the data controller will ensure the fairness, transparency, and unambiguity of the consent process.
  6. Critical Analysis: The policy provides a clear choice for users to accept or decline cookies, and offers granular control over cookie preferences. However, it may fail to meet GDPR requirements if additional details about the lawful basis for processing personal data are not provided, or if the purpose of data processing is not clearly stated.
  7. Final Justification: The policy was classified as Partially Compliant because, while it provides choices for users and explains each type of cookie used, it could further improve transparency by offering more detailed information about the lawful basis for processing personal data and the purpose of data processing.
  8. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance GDPR compliance, add clear explanations of the legal basis for processing personal data, the purpose of data processing, and the specific rights of users in relation to their personal data (e.g., access, rectification, erasure, etc.).

   - There is granular control over cookies as users can customize their cookie preferences according to their choice.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed in the policy, stating that data may be transferred outside the EU/EEA and may be used by 203 third-party vendors for various purposes such as personalized advertising, content, and audience research.
   - The purpose of data processing is transparent, but it could be more understandable by providing simpler explanations or examples for each cookie category (e.g., Essential Cookies).

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant] – The policy explains that the user's consent is required to process their personal data and use cookies, which aligns with the GDPR definition of consent.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Non-compliant] – Although users are given an option to choose or decline cookies, their continued use of the website without modification of cookie settings can be seen as implicit consent, which might not meet the GDPR requirements for explicit and informed consent.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - The policy provides granular control over cookies and discloses data sharing with third parties, but it might not fully comply with Article 7 since users may give their implicit consent by continuing to use the website without modifying cookie settings.

7. Final Justification:
   - The classification is Partially Compliant because the policy offers granular control over cookies and discloses data sharing with third parties but does not ensure explicit consent from users as required by GDPR Article 7.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To improve GDPR compliance, consider modifying the policy to require active acceptance of cookie settings to ensure explicit and informed consent before processing any personal data or using cookies. This can be done by displaying a pop-up message each time the user visits the website asking for their consent. Additionally, provide clearer explanations for each cookie category in an easily understandable format."
verbose_compliance,compliant,compliant-22.docx,mistral:latest," In this text, the author provides information about cookies and how they are used on a website. The text is organized into several sections:

1. **Modifications and Details**: This section explains that users can manage their cookie preferences using features on the website and changing their browser settings. It also mentions that some cookies may be processed in countries outside of the European Union (EU), which may not provide the same level of data protection as EU countries.
2. **Analytics and Marketing Cookies**: This section describes these types of cookies, which are used to collect information about user behavior on the website to improve its functionality and display advertising tailored to users' interests. The text mentions that if a user rejects these cookies, they may not benefit from some features on the website or see personalized ads.
3. **First-Party Cookies**: This section explains that first-party cookies are placed on the website by the site owner or contracted service providers and interact with users as they continue to use the website.
4. **Third-Party Cookies**: This section describes third-party cookies, which may be placed on the website by other providers (third-party providers) during a user's visit. The text advises users to go to the website of the third-party provider for more information about their use of cookies and provides a link to revoke consent for these cookies.
5. **Rejecting Cookies**: This section explains that if users reject cookies, the site will stop placing those cookies requiring consent starting from their next visit to a new page. The text also mentions that revoking consent to cookies won't result in less advertising but will prevent ads from being tailored to users' interests.
6. **Cookie Management in your browser**: This section provides instructions for managing cookie settings through the website's features and changing browser settings. The text cautions that changing cookie settings may affect some features on the website.
7. **Where is the information collected by cookies processed?**: This section explains where the information collected via cookies is primarily processed, which is within the extended European Union (EU). However, in some cases, it may be processed outside of the EU in countries that don't provide the same level of data protection. The text mentions that additional security measures have been implemented to protect this information.
8. **Accept selected / Reject / Accept all**: These sections allow users to accept or reject different categories of cookies on the website, such as analytics and marketing cookies, or all cookies altogether."

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Explicit consent is given through the acceptance of the cookie settings, which is presented clearly in the Cookie Settings section. Users are informed that they can revoke their consent at any time. However, the initial presentation of the request for consent could be improved to ensure it is freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous, as required by GDPR.
     - Withdrawal of consent is facilitated through the Cookie Manager, where users can easily adjust their preferences. The mechanism appears to be straightforward and user-friendly.
  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types under the 'Cookie Manager'. They can opt for either only technically necessary cookies or accept all cookies. However, the granularity could be improved by offering separate controls for analytics, personalization, and marketing cookies.
     - Although users have some control over cookies (accepting only technical cookies), it is not as granular as GDPR would require for fully compliant implementation. Users should be able to select which specific cookies they consent to, rather than having to accept or reject entire categories.
  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed, although the nature of the data shared isn't explicitly specified. The privacy policy provides more detailed information about this.
     - The purpose of data processing is made transparent in that cookies are used for marketing, analytics, and personalization purposes. However, the explanation could be improved to ensure it is concise, clear, and understandable for users.
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The cookie policy seems to meet the requirements of Article 4(11), as explicit consent is obtained from users before collecting their personal data through cookies.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy partially complies with Article 7, as it offers a mechanism for users to withdraw their consent. However, the initial request for consent could be improved to ensure it is given freely, specifically, and in an informed manner. Additionally, GDPR requires that the user's positive action should clearly indicate their consent, which currently appears to be assumed upon clicking 'Accept all'.
  6. Critical Analysis: The policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements regarding granularity of consent, as users do not have the option to select specific cookies they wish to allow or deny. Furthermore, the initial request for consent is not presented in a way that ensures it is freely given, specifically informed, and unambiguously understood by users.
  7. Final Justification: The policy was classified as Partially Compliant because it does meet some GDPR requirements, such as offering users the ability to withdraw their consent and disclosing data sharing with third parties. However, it falls short in areas like providing a granular choice for cookie types and ensuring that the initial request for consent is compliant with GDPR guidelines.
  8. Improvement Suggestions: To improve GDPR compliance, the following steps can be taken:
     - Present the initial request for consent more clearly and ensure it meets the requirements of being freely given, specifically informed, and unambiguously understood by users.
     - Offer a granular choice for specific cookie types that users wish to allow or deny. This will provide users with greater control over their data.
     - Improve the explanation of the purpose of data processing to ensure it is concise, clear, and understandable for users.
     - Specify the nature of the data shared with third parties in the cookie policy."

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented. (Partially Compliant): The policy presents the purpose of cookies and explains that users can manage their preferences, indicating that they are giving consent. However, the policy does not provide a clear affirmative action for users to confirm their consent explicitly.
     - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism. (Compliant): Users can manage and adjust their cookie preferences at any time, effectively withdrawing their consent as needed.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. (Partially Compliant): The policy provides options for managing performance, functional, social media, and personalization cookies, but it does not clearly distinguish between strictly necessary cookies from the other categories, as users cannot opt-out of strictly necessary cookies.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? (Compliant): Users can adjust cookie settings to block specific types of cookies (performance, functional, social media, and personalization) if they choose.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? (Compliant): The policy explains that third-party providers may set cookies on the site to provide enhanced functionality, show relevant ads, or track user browsing behavior.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? (Partially Compliant): While the policy outlines the purpose of each type of cookie, it does not explicitly state the specific purposes for data collection and processing by third parties.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Non-Compliant]: The policy does not present a clear affirmative action for users to give explicit consent, as required by GDPR. Consent should be given through an active opt-in or checkbox mechanism.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant]: Users are provided with information about cookie purposes and given the option to manage their preferences, fulfilling some of the conditions for consent under GDPR. However, users do not explicitly confirm their consent through a clear affirmative action.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements: The policy does not provide a clear and explicit way for users to give consent, which is essential under GDPR. Additionally, there is no clear distinction between strictly necessary cookies and other cookie categories, making it impossible for users to fully comply with GDPR by opting out of all non-essential cookies.

7. Final Justification:
   - Clearly explain why the classification was chosen: The policy is partially compliant because it discloses information about cookies, provides a mechanism for managing preferences, and offers granular control over certain types of cookies. However, it does not meet all GDPR requirements regarding explicit consent and clear distinction between strictly necessary and other cookie categories.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Practical steps to enhance GDPR compliance:
     - Include a checkbox or affirmative action for users to explicitly confirm their consent when first visiting the site.
     - Clearly distinguish between strictly necessary cookies and other categories, allowing users to opt-out of non-essential cookies if they choose.

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented: Yes, explicit consent is given as users are required to actively accept the use of cookies by clicking a button. The cookie policy is also directly accessible within the banner.
     - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism: Users can easily withdraw their consent by revisiting the cookie settings and changing their preferences at any time.
  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain: Yes, users are presented with two options: ""Necessary cookies only"" or ""Accept all."" This gives users a level of control over the cookies they accept. However, there is no granular control over specific types of cookies beyond these two categories.
     - Is granular control over cookies offered?: No, users cannot select specific types of cookies to accept or reject.
  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? Yes, the policy provides details about the third-party providers (e.g., 2B-Advice, Cloudflare, .etracker.com) and the purpose of their cookies (e.g., analytics, load balancing).
     - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? Yes, the policy provides a brief explanation for each cookie type, making it relatively easy to understand the purpose of data processing.
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant] The policy presents a clear and active process for obtaining user consent, which aligns with the GDPR's definition of consent.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] Although users are presented with an option to accept or reject cookies, the choice is not granular enough to meet the requirements for specific categories of processing under Article 7(4).
  6. Critical Analysis:
     - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements: The policy does not offer users a granular control over the acceptance or rejection of specific types of cookies, which is a requirement under Article 7(4) of the GDPR. Additionally, while users are provided with information about third-party providers and the purpose of their cookies, it would be beneficial to also explain how long the data will be stored, as this is another GDPR requirement.
  7. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR due to the active consent process but falls short in offering granular control over specific cookie types and providing complete transparency about data storage times.
  8. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance GDPR compliance, consider adding a more detailed section explaining the retention periods for each cookie type and offering users the ability to select specific categories of cookies that they are comfortable with, rather than just two broad options (all or necessary)."
verbose_compliance,compliant,compliant-26.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented. (Compliant): The user is explicitly asked to accept or reject all cookies.
     - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism. (Partially Compliant): Users can change their cookie preferences at any time through the 'cookie settings' option, but there's no immediate and visible way to withdraw consent after it has been given.

   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. (Partially Compliant): Users can choose between ""Reject all"" and ""Accept all"", but they cannot select specific types of cookies to accept or reject.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? (Non-Compliant): The policy does not provide granular control over the specific cookies that are stored on the device.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? (Partially Compliant): The policy mentions that ""cookies can be set by our advertising partners via our website"", but it does not specify which specific third parties are involved or the purpose of data processing.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? (Non-Compliant): The purpose of data processing is not clearly explained in a manner that users can easily understand.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially Compliant + Reason]: The policy does ask for user consent, but it may not meet the GDPR requirement of obtaining 'clear and affirmative action' since accepting all cookies is the default option.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Non-Compliant + Reason]: The policy does not provide a way to withdraw consent easily, and users are not informed about their right to do so. It also does not provide clear and comprehensive information about what data is being collected and why it is needed.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements: The policy fails to meet GDPR requirements in several key aspects, such as providing granular control over cookies, clearly explaining the purpose of data processing, and offering an easily accessible mechanism for withdrawing consent.

7. Final Justification:
   - Clearly explain why the classification was chosen: The policy is partially compliant because it does ask for user consent, but it fails to meet several GDPR requirements, such as providing granular control over cookies, clearly explaining the purpose of data processing, and offering an easily accessible mechanism for withdrawing consent.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Practical steps to enhance GDPR compliance:
     - Offer a more granular control over cookie settings, allowing users to select specific types of cookies to accept or reject.

verbose_compliance,compliant,compliant-28.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Classification: Partially Compliant

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented. The policy presents an explicit form of consent, as users are given the option to either accept all cookies or deny them all. However, there is no granular control over specific cookie types.
   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism. Users can revoke their consent at any time by denying all cookies in the settings section or deleting their cookies. The policy lacks an easy and prominent way to withdraw consent once it has been given.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. Users are not offered granular control over specific cookie types, as they can only accept all or deny all cookies.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? The policy does not provide granular control over individual cookies.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? Yes, the policy indicates that user data may be processed in countries outside the EU. However, it lacks specific details about which third parties have access to this data and for what purposes.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? The policy does provide a general description of the purposes for which data will be processed (analysis, marketing, content personalization, and interaction with social media platforms). However, it could benefit from more specific and detailed explanations to make the purpose of data processing more transparent and understandable.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy complies with Article 4(11), as it presents a freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous form of consent. However, the lack of granular control over specific cookie types may raise questions about whether this consent is truly explicit and informed.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy complies with Article 7, as it provides a clear and comprehensive description of the processing operations and their purposes. However, users may struggle to withdraw consent once it has been given, which could be non-compliant with GDPR requirements for easy withdrawal.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. The policy lacks granular control over specific cookies and an easy mechanism for users to withdraw consent once it has been given, which are key requirements under GDPR. Additionally, the policy could benefit from more detailed explanations about data sharing with third parties and the purposes for which this data will be processed.

7. Final Justification: The classification of ""Partially Compliant"" is chosen because while the policy presents an explicit form of consent, it lacks granular control over specific cookie types and a user-friendly way to withdraw consent once given.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To enhance GDPR compliance, the following steps can be taken:
     - Provide users with a granular control option to choose specific cookie types.
     - Implement an easy and prominent mechanism for users to withdraw their consent at any time.
     - Offer more detailed explanations about data sharing with third parties and the purposes for which this data will be processed.

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Explicit consent is given, as users are prompted to accept cookies upon entering the website.
     - Users can easily withdraw consent by visiting the ""Settings"" section and selecting desired cookie categories or revoking all permissions.

  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Users are provided with an option to select specific cookie types, though some categories (like ""Technically required only"" and ""Agree to all"") might not meet the requirement for granular control over cookies as they do not allow for individual selection of cookies within these groups.

  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed under the ""Settings"" section, though it could be more transparent by explicitly naming the partner services used on the website.
     - The purpose of data processing is mentioned in a general way (to improve the user-friendliness and performance of the websites), but specific purposes for each category of cookies would make it more understandable.

  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy appears to meet this requirement, as explicit consent is given and users are informed about the purpose of data processing.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): There seems to be a partial compliance as users are given clear choices, but the option to revoke consent only applies to cookie settings rather than specific purposes of data processing. This may not meet the requirement of separate and informed consent according to GDPR.

  6. Critical Analysis:
     - The policy could improve by offering granular control over individual cookies within a given category, providing more transparency in naming partner services used on the website, and ensuring that users can revoke consent for specific purposes of data processing rather than just cookie settings.

  7. Final Justification:
     - The classification is ""Partially Compliant"" because while the policy offers some transparency and a mechanism to withdraw consent, it does not meet all the requirements regarding granular control over cookies and separate revocation options for specific purposes of data processing as stated in GDPR.

  8. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Introduce granular control over individual cookies within each category.
     - List partner services used on the website explicitly.
     - Provide users with an option to revoke consent for specific purposes of data processing, not just cookie settings."

  6. Critical Analysis:
      - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. Although the policy offers granular control over cookies and is transparent about data processing purposes, it may not be immediately apparent how to modify consent settings, which could potentially impact users' ability to easily withdraw their consent. It would be helpful to provide a more straightforward way for users to access and adjust their cookie preferences, such as incorporating the ""Adjust"" option into the initial consent screen or offering an easily accessible ""Manage Cookies"" link within the website.
  7. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it provides users with a clear explanation of data processing purposes and offers granular control over cookies. However, the presentation and ease of access to the withdrawal mechanism can be improved for better user experience and compliance with GDPR requirements.
  8. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance GDPR compliance, consider modifying the policy to make it more apparent how users can adjust their cookie preferences. This could include incorporating the ""Adjust"" option into the initial consent screen or offering an easily accessible ""Manage Cookies"" link within the website.

     - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. (Partially Compliant) Users can view and choose individual settings in the ""Cookie Settings,"" but they cannot accept or deny specific cookies at the initial prompt; instead, they must accept all cookies to continue using the site.
     - Is granular control over cookies offered? (Partially Compliant) As users can access and change their cookie preferences in the ""Cookie Settings,"" there is a degree of granular control over cookies, but it's not immediately accessible at the point of consent.

  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? (Compliant) The policy mentions that data may be transferred to and processed by third parties, depending on their function, indicating a certain level of transparency.
     - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? (Partially Compliant) Although the policy refers to using cookies for various purposes (e.g., marketing, functionality, security), users might find it challenging to grasp the specifics without additional explanation or context.

  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially Compliant + Reason] The policy complies with the spirit of Article 4(11), as it provides a mechanism for obtaining user consent, but it does not explicitly state that the user's ongoing consent is ""specific, informed and unambiguous.""
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant + Reason] The policy partially adheres to Article 7 since it offers users the ability to withdraw their consent. However, the policy does not clearly state that consent is obtained on an individual basis (i.e., for each specific purpose), as required by this article.

  6. Critical Analysis:
     - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. The policy lacks clarity in terms of specific, informed, and unambiguous consent, as well as not immediately offering granular control over cookies upon initial visit.

  7. Final Justification: The classification is Partially Compliant due to the presence of a revocation mechanism for user consent but a lack of immediate granularity in the consent prompt and issues with specific and informed consent.

  8. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Update the policy to offer more explicit, specific, and informed consent by outlining each cookie's purpose at the point of initial request.
     - Provide a mechanism for users to select specific cookies at the initial prompt, allowing them to immediately make granular choices about their consent."

     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant] The policy provides users with clear and concise information about their consent, and users are given a free choice to accept or reject the use of cookies. Additionally, users can easily withdraw their consent at any time.
  6. Critical Analysis:
     - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements: The policy could be more explicit in informing users about the exact types of personal data that will be collected and processed through cookies. Additionally, the policy should provide a clear explanation of how long user data will be stored and whether it will be transferred to countries outside the EU.
  7. Final Justification:
     - Clearly explain why the classification was chosen: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR because it provides users with clear information about their consent, allows them to withdraw their consent at any time, and offers granular control over cookies. However, it could be improved by being more explicit about the types of personal data collected and processed through cookies.
  8. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Practical steps to enhance GDPR compliance: Add a detailed section explaining the types of personal data that will be collected and processed through cookies. Provide information on how long user data will be stored, whether it will be transferred to countries outside the EU, and the measures taken to ensure adequate protection. Make sure users are informed about their rights regarding access, correction, erasure, and data portability under GDPR."
verbose_compliance,compliant,compliant-32.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Classification: Partially Compliant - The cookie policy provides some information about the types of cookies used, their purpose, and the option to accept or reject them. However, it does not meet all GDPR requirements for transparency and granular control.

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented. Compliant - The user is clearly asked to give their consent before any cookies are stored on their device, and the method of giving this consent (by clicking ""Accept All Cookies"") is easy to understand.
   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism. Compliant - Users can withdraw their consent at any time by changing their preferences in the cookie settings or by following the link provided for more information on ""Data Protection Statement"".

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. Partially Compliant - While users can choose between ""Accept All Cookies"" and customize their preferences, they cannot choose specific cookie types individually which may not be in line with GDPR's requirement for granular control over cookies.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? Partially Compliant - Users can manage their consent preferences, but the level of granularity is limited as they can only allow all cookies or set specific preferences. However, this could be argued to meet the GDPR requirements for offering some level of control.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? Compliant - The policy states that data may be transferred to countries outside the EEA without an adequate level of data protection, which could include data shared with third parties. However, it is not explicitly stated who these third parties are.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? Compliant - The purpose of using cookies (to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in marketing efforts) is made clear to users, although the specific purposes for each type of cookie may be less clear due to a lack of granularity.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] Compliant - The policy meets the GDPR definition of consent as it is specific, informed, and freely given by the user. The user is clearly presented with the choice to accept or reject cookies, and can easily withdraw their consent at any time.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] Compliant - The policy meets the GDPR requirements for transparency as it provides information about the types of cookies used and their purpose, although the specific purposes for each type of cookie may not be clear enough. Users are also given the option to accept or reject cookies, and can withdraw their consent at any time.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. One key area where the policy may fall short is in providing a sufficient level of transparency regarding third-party data sharing. While it does mention that data may be transferred outside the EEA, it does not specify which third parties this data might be shared with. Additionally, while users can choose to accept or reject all cookies, they cannot make granular choices about specific cookie types.

7. Final Justification:
   - The classification was chosen as the policy meets most GDPR requirements for consent and transparency, but could improve in terms of providing a clearer picture of third-party data sharing and offering more granular control over cookies.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To enhance GDPR compliance, the cookie policy could be updated to clearly state which third parties the user's data may be shared with. Additionally, the ability for users to make individual choices about specific cookie types should be added to give them greater control over their privacy preferences. This could involve redesigning the cookie settings interface to allow for more granular control."

The cookie policy provides information about the use of cookies, offers a choice for users to select specific categories of cookies (granular control), and explains how users can withdraw their consent. However, it lacks clarity in disclosing data sharing with third parties, which is essential for GDPR compliance.

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Explicit consent is given through the presentation of different categories of cookies and the ability to accept or refuse them.
   - Users can easily withdraw their consent by clicking on ""Deny and continue"" at any time during their browsing session. The policy does not indicate whether this setting will persist across future sessions, which may require further clarification for GDPR compliance.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types (Marketing, Functional, Essential). This offers granular control over cookies.
   - The policy does not appear to offer granular control within each category (e.g., which specific marketing or functional cookies to accept or refuse). More details may be needed for full compliance with GDPR requirements.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed but not in a clear and easily accessible manner, as it is only mentioned within the ""more settings"" section. This could potentially fail to meet GDPR requirements for transparency.
   - The purpose of data processing is transparent (to enable certain functions on the website), but it would be beneficial to further explain this purpose in a user-friendly manner.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy presents a valid definition of consent as an unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, freely, specific, informed and explicit, signifies agreement to personal data relating to him or her being processed. [Compliant]
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy meets most requirements under Article 7, as it provides clear information about the processing of personal data, the right to withdraw consent, and offers granular control over cookies. However, it may need additional clarification on how the settings will persist across future sessions for complete compliance. [Partially Compliant]

6. Critical Analysis:
   - The policy lacks clarity in disclosing data sharing with third parties, which could potentially fail to meet GDPR requirements for transparency.
   - Additional details may be needed on how the settings will persist across future sessions to ensure the user's choice remains consistent over time.

7. Final Justification:
   - The policy is partially compliant as it offers granular control, presents explicit consent, and allows users to easily withdraw their consent. However, the lack of clarity in disclosing data sharing with third parties and additional details on how settings persist across sessions may cause potential non-compliance with GDPR requirements.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Clearly display information about data sharing with third parties within the initial consent prompt to ensure transparency.
   - Offer granular control over each category of cookies (e.g., specific marketing or functional cookies) to meet the requirements for granular control under GDPR.
   - Clarify how the user's settings will persist across sessions, such as by indicating that they will need to revisit this setting on future visits if they wish their choices to remain consistent."

     - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed in the policy, but it could be more explicit and detailed to meet GDPR requirements.
     - The purpose of data processing is transparent as it is explained briefly in the policy. However, more detail might be needed for full compliance.

  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy does not explicitly state that consent is ""specific, informed and unambiguous"", which is required by GDPR. Instead, it presents a binary choice (""Accept All"" or ""Deny All""). This could be improved to provide more specific and unambiguous consent options.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy does not explicitly state that consent must be as easy to withdraw as to give, which is required by GDPR. However, users can easily withdraw their consent through the ""Individual Settings"" section.

  6. Critical Analysis:
     - Although the policy provides an option to accept or deny cookies, it does not meet the granularity requirements for GDPR compliance. Users should be able to select specific cookie types they consent to.
     - The language used in the policy could be more clear and concise to ensure users understand their rights and the implications of their choices.

  7. Final Justification:
     - The policy is partially compliant as it provides an option for users to accept or deny cookies, but it does not offer granular control over specific cookie types, which is required by GDPR.

  8. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Add explicit choices for each type of cookie (technical, functional, commission/billing, marketing) so users can give granular consent.

  3. Granular Consent and Options:
    - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain: Yes, users are given granular control over the types of cookies they allow. They can choose between Required Cookies, Functional Cookies, and Marketing Cookies. However, it is not clear whether all third-party cookies are included in these categories.
    - Is granular control over cookies offered? Yes, users have the option to block or allow specific categories of cookies.

  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
    - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? No, the policy does not provide a clear explanation about data sharing with third parties. It only mentions that functional and marketing cookies may come from services provided by other companies (autonomous third-party providers).
    - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? The policy provides a general purpose for using cookies, but it does not clearly explain the specific purposes for which personal data will be processed.

  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
    - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Non-Compliant] - The consent mechanism in this policy does not meet the GDPR requirement for a ""clear and affirmative act"" since users do not explicitly agree before any personal data is processed.
    - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] - Although users are given an option to decline cookies, the policy lacks clarity regarding the consequences of doing so and does not provide a clear link to the privacy policy before asking for consent.

  6. Critical Analysis:
    - The policy fails to meet GDPR requirements in several areas, including providing clear information about data processing purposes, data retention periods, and data sharing with third parties. It also lacks a detailed explanation of the legal basis for processing personal data and does not clearly define how users can withdraw consent at any time.

  7. Final Justification:
    - The classification is Partially Compliant because while the policy allows users to decline cookies and offers some granular control over them, it lacks clarity in several key areas required by GDPR, such as data processing purposes, data retention periods, and third-party data sharing.

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Explicit consent is presented as users must actively accept the use of cookies by clicking on 'Accept All'. However, it is not explicitly clear if all cookies (essential and statistics) require user's consent, which could potentially make the consent non-specific. To improve compliance, a clear statement specifying that both essential and statistical cookies require user consent is recommended.
   - Users can easily withdraw their consent by using the 'Save & close selection' option to decline all cookies. This mechanism meets GDPR requirements.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types, as they can choose either 'Essential' or 'Statistic' cookies. However, there is no option for users to selectively accept or decline individual cookies of each category (e.g., essential sub-cookies or statistic sub-cookies). This lack of granular control over cookies may lead to non-compliance with GDPR. To enhance compliance, offering more specific options for consenting to the use of different types of cookies is recommended.
   - Granular control over cookies is not offered in the current policy, as users can only choose between two broad categories (essential and statistic) instead of selecting individual cookies. This lack of granularity could lead to non-compliance with GDPR. To improve compliance, providing more specific options for consenting to the use of different types of cookies is recommended.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - It is not explicitly clear whether or not data is shared with third parties as there is no statement about third-party data sharing in the policy. To meet GDPR requirements, disclosing any data sharing with third parties should be included in the policy.
   - The purpose of data processing is partially transparent and understandable, as users are informed that essential cookies secure basic website functions and statistic cookies help website owners to understand how visitors interact with websites. However, more specific information about the type of data processed (e.g., personal vs. non-personal) and the purposes for which it will be used should be provided to meet GDPR requirements.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy does not explicitly state that consent is given freely, specifically informed, unambiguously stated, and easily withdrawn, which may lead to non-compliance with this article. To improve compliance, clearly stating that users can freely withdraw their consent at any time should be included in the policy.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy does not meet all of the conditions required by this article as explicit consent is only provided through active acceptance, and it is not clear whether or not data is shared with third parties. To enhance compliance, providing a clear statement about data sharing with third parties and ensuring that consent is specific (i.e., for each type of cookie) should be included in the policy.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - The policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements as it does not explicitly state that users can withdraw their consent, does not provide granular control over cookies, and lacks transparency regarding data sharing with third parties. Additionally, the policy could be improved by providing more specific information about the type of data processed and its intended use.

7. Final Justification:
   - The classification is 'Partially Compliant' as the policy requires users to actively accept cookies, provides a mechanism for withdrawing consent, but lacks granular control over cookies, transparency regarding data sharing with third parties, and specificity in data processing information.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To enhance GDPR compliance, the policy should provide more specific options for consenting to the use of different types of cookies, offer granular control over individual cookies, clearly state that users can withdraw their consent at any time, disclose any data sharing with third parties, and include more specific information about the type of data processed and its intended use."

     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] While users are able to give and withdraw their consent, the policy fails to meet the requirement of providing clear and comprehensive information about the processing operations before obtaining user consent, making it less transparent than required by GDPR.
  6. Critical Analysis: The cookie policy fails to provide adequate transparency about data processing activities and third-party sharing, which may lead users to inadvertently agree to terms they do not fully understand. Additionally, the granularity of user options for managing their cookie preferences could be improved by providing clearer explanations for each category of cookies.
  7. Final Justification: The classification is ""Partially Compliant"" because while users can manage their cookie preferences and give/withdraw consent, the policy does not meet all the transparency requirements set out in GDPR regarding data processing activities and third-party sharing.
  8. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance GDPR compliance, Symrise should provide detailed information about the nature, scope, and purposes of each type of cookie before obtaining user consent. They should also make their policy more transparent by clearly disclosing any third-party data sharing and ensuring that users have a more granular control over their cookie preferences with clear explanations for each category of cookies."

However, they can choose to allow all, manage preferences, or reject optional cookies.
   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism. [Compliant]: Users have the ability to change their cookie preferences at any time by revisiting the cookie banner and managing their choices. They can either select ""Reject optional cookies"" to block non-essential cookies or ""Allow all"" to accept them all.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. [Partially compliant]: Users are provided with the option to choose between allowing all, managing preferences, or rejecting optional cookies. However, they cannot select specific types of cookies (performance or marketing).
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? [Non-Compliant]: The policy does not provide users with granular control over the individual cookies being set.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:

   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? [Partially compliant]: While the purpose of using performance cookies is clear (improving user experience), the purpose for using marketing cookies could be more explicitly stated in layman's terms to make it easier for users to understand.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially compliant]: The policy provides a legitimate interest as the legal basis for strictly necessary cookies, which is not in line with GDPR's definition of consent under Article 4(11). However, it does offer users an option to manage or reject non-essential cookies.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially compliant]: Although users are presented with the option to accept or reject cookies, explicit and informed consent is not obtained for each specific type of cookie, which falls short of GDPR requirements in this regard.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. [Partially Compliant]: The policy lacks granularity in obtaining user consent for different types of cookies and does not offer a clear explanation of the legal basis for using performance and marketing cookies.

7. Final Justification:

     The cookie policy provides some information about the use of cookies, purposes of data processing, and options for users to choose the categories of cookies they accept. However, it lacks clarity in certain areas such as explicit consent, granular control over cookies, and third-party data sharing disclosures, which are essential aspects under GDPR.

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented: The policy presents the option to accept or decline all cookies, but it does not explicitly ask for users' prior and informed consent. While there is an option to change the decision later, the initial acceptance is not active (pre-ticked) or clearly distinguishable from other options, which goes against the GDPR requirements.
     - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism: Users can withdraw their consent by adjusting the cookie settings at any time. The mechanism seems user-friendly and easy to locate.

  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain: Yes, users are given options to choose the categories of cookies they accept or decline: necessary, comfort, statistics/range measurement, and third-party services. However, the policy does not offer granular control over each individual cookie within these categories.
     - Is granular control over cookies offered?: No, users cannot select specific cookies within each category. They can only choose to accept or decline entire categories.

  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? The policy mentions the use of third-party services (e.g., Google Analytics, YouTube Video), but it does not provide clear information about their specific purposes or how they may process users' personal data.
     - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable?: The policy explains that cookies are used for statistics and to serve ads relevant to users' interests, but it lacks clarity on the precise purposes of data processing and how these activities improve the quality of the website.

  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy does not seem to comply with this article because it does not ask for explicit, specific, freely given, and informed consent from users. The initial acceptance of cookies is not active or clearly distinguishable from other options, which goes against the GDPR requirements.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy seems to partially comply with this article as it offers some options for users to choose the categories of cookies they accept or decline. However, it does not provide granular control over each individual cookie within these categories, which is essential under GDPR.

  6. Critical Analysis:
     - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements: The policy lacks clarity in obtaining explicit and informed consent from users, offering granular control over cookies, and disclosing clear information about third-party data sharing and purposes of data processing. It also fails to address potential risks related to data transfers to countries with insufficient data protection levels (e.g., the USA).

  7. Final Justification: The policy is classified as partially compliant because it only partially meets the GDPR requirements, mainly due to a lack of explicit consent, granular control over cookies, and clear disclosures about third-party data sharing and purposes of data processing.

  8. Improvement Suggestions:
     - To enhance GDPR compliance, the following steps are recommended:
       a) Request explicit and specific consent from users before setting any cookies on their devices.
       b) Offer granular control over individual cookies within each category to allow users to make more informed decisions.
       c) Provide clear information about third-party data sharing, purposes of data processing, and potential risks related to international data transfers (e.g., data protection levels in the USA).
       d) Review the policy regularly to ensure continued compliance with GDPR requirements."

   2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
       - Explicit consent is given through the presentation of a clear cookie policy statement, and users are asked to select their preferences before using the website. However, it is not immediately obvious that this consent is 'explicit' as per GDPR definition (Article 4(11)). It may be more explicit by providing a separate window or checkbox for each type of cookie category instead of grouping them together.
       - Users can withdraw their consent at any time by changing their preferences through the provided cookie settings. This mechanism is easily accessible and user-friendly.

   3. Granular Consent and Options:
       - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types, although they are grouped together in categories rather than having individual control over each cookie. This can be improved by offering more granular control over the cookies used on the site.
       - There is no granular control over cookies offered as of now, but users can choose between allowing all cookies, selecting specific categories, or using only necessary cookies.

   4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
       - The website does disclose data sharing with third parties (social media, advertising, and analytics partners) but it may not be clear enough for users to understand the exact extent of this data sharing. Providing more specific details about the nature and purpose of shared data can improve transparency.
       - The purpose of data processing is somewhat transparent as it is mentioned that cookies are used for personalizing content, ads, providing social media features, and analyzing traffic. However, a clearer and more detailed explanation may be necessary to ensure full understanding by users.

   5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
       - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The current policy uses the term 'consent' but the presentation of choices may not meet the GDPR definition of 'explicit' consent as it does not involve a clear affirmative action from the user. [Partially Compliant]
       - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The conditions for consent are partially met, as users are provided with an option to select their preferences before using the site. However, the explicit nature of consent may not be fully compliant with GDPR requirements. [Partially Compliant]

   6. Critical Analysis: The policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements in terms of providing explicit consent as it does not involve a clear affirmative action from the user. Additionally, more granular control over cookies and improved transparency regarding data sharing with third parties would be beneficial.

   7. Final Justification: The classification was chosen because the policy offers users a choice to select their preferences before using the site, but it does not meet all GDPR requirements for explicit consent, granular control over cookies, and complete transparency regarding data sharing with third parties.

   8. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance GDPR compliance, consider redesigning the cookie policy window to present each cookie category as individual checkboxes, providing more detailed explanations about data sharing with third parties, and offering a clearer explanation of the purpose of data processing. Additionally, make sure that users can easily withdraw their consent at any time by changing their preferences through an accessible settings menu."

  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types (Necessary, Performance, Marketing) but are not offered granular control over each individual service within these categories.
     - There is no explicit ability for users to provide consent on an individual service basis, which may limit their control and understanding of the data processing taking place.
  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - The policy discloses data sharing with third parties (services listed in the Customize section), but the level of detail provided varies by service and is not always easily understandable without additional research.
     - The purpose of data processing is generally transparent, but some services may not have detailed descriptions or may be auto-translated from non-English sources, which could potentially affect clarity.
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy does provide a clear and affirmative action for consent, but the granularity of options may not meet the standard of specific and informed consent required under GDPR. [Partially Compliant]
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy allows users to freely give and withdraw their consent easily, and it is presented in an accessible manner. However, the level of granularity provided may not fully meet the requirements for granular control over data processing. [Partially Compliant]
  6. Critical Analysis:
     - The policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements due to the lack of explicit, granular control options available to users regarding individual services and data processing purposes.
  7. Final Justification:
     - The policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it provides a clear consent mechanism and allows users to easily withdraw their consent, but it does not offer the level of granularity required for specific and informed consent under GDPR.
  8. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Offer more detailed descriptions of each service and its purpose in an accessible format.
     - Provide users with the ability to control individual services or data processing purposes rather than just categories.

   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain: Yes, users are presented with a list of categories (Marketing & Analytics, Essential) and specific services associated with each category. They can choose which ones they agree or deny by toggling the settings.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered?: Yes, the policy offers a level of granular control as users can select which types of cookies they allow or deny. However, some cookie categories (like Marketing & Analytics) include multiple third-party services, and users might not have the ability to manage each service individually within this category.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly?: Yes, the policy discloses that data is shared with third-party providers for marketing, analytics, and other purposes. Each service is listed under specific categories in the cookie settings.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? : Yes, the policy provides a clear explanation of why the cookies are used and how they collect and analyze online behavior. However, some users might find the detailed list of services and their functions confusing or overwhelming.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] : Compliant - The policy provides a clear, affirmative action (clicking 'I agree') to give consent for the processing of personal data.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] : Compliant - Users are provided with information about the specific processing activities and given a choice to consent or not, and they can easily withdraw their consent at any time.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements: The policy could potentially improve by simplifying the list of third-party services and providing more granular control for each service within specific categories. This would help users better understand the data processing activities and make informed decisions about their privacy settings.

7. Final Justification:
   - Clearly explain why the classification was chosen: The policy is partially compliant because it meets most of the GDPR requirements, including providing clear information about cookie usage, offering a choice to consent or deny cookies, and allowing users to withdraw their consent at any time. However, the detailed list of third-party services may cause confusion for some users, potentially compromising transparency and comprehension.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Practical steps to enhance GDPR compliance:
     - Simplify the list of third-party service providers within each category.
     - Offer more granular control over individual services (if possible) within specific categories.
     - Provide clear and concise explanations for each cookie category and associated services.
     - Use user-friendly language and design elements to make the policy easier to understand and navigate for users."
verbose_compliance,compliant,compliant-48.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Classification: Partially Compliant

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Explicit consent is given as users are required to actively accept cookies by selecting either 'ACCEPT ONLY ESSENTIALS', 'SAVE AND CLOSE' or 'ACCEPT ALL'. However, the option for 'SAVE AND CLOSE' may be ambiguous as it could potentially be interpreted that the user has accepted all cookies, which is not strictly explicit.
     - Users can easily withdraw consent by either rejecting cookies initially (by not actively accepting them) or by deleting cookies from their browser settings. However, there is no straightforward mechanism provided within the cookie policy itself to manage or modify cookie preferences once they have been set.

  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types (Essential, Analytics & Performance, External content). This provides granular control over cookies, which is compliant with GDPR.
     - There is no mechanism offered to adjust or modify these preferences after initial consent has been given, which may be considered as a lack of granularity in ongoing management of cookie settings.

  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed by the grouping of cookies into 'Analytics & Performance' and 'External content'. However, it would be more transparent to list specific third-party vendors used in these categories.
     - The purpose of data processing is disclosed, but it could be made more understandable for users who may not be familiar with technical terms such as ""analytical tracking"" or ""external content"".

  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially Compliant] The policy uses active consent, but the 'SAVE AND CLOSE' option may create ambiguity as to whether users have given explicit consent or not. This needs clarification to be fully compliant with Article 4(11).
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant] The policy is clear about the use of cookies, the purpose of data processing, and the right to withdraw consent. However, it lacks a mechanism for managing cookie preferences after initial consent has been given, which may be seen as a potential area for improvement under Article 7(5).

  6. Critical Analysis:
     - The policy fails to meet GDPR requirements in terms of providing a clear and unambiguous means of giving consent, particularly with the 'SAVE AND CLOSE' option. Additionally, there is no ongoing mechanism for managing or modifying cookie preferences after initial consent has been given.

  7. Final Justification:
     - The policy is partially compliant due to the issues identified in the analysis, particularly around the clarification of active consent and providing a means of managing cookie preferences beyond the initial setting.

  8. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Clarify the 'SAVE AND CLOSE' option to ensure that users understand they have not given explicit consent to all cookies.
     - Implement a mechanism for managing or modifying cookie preferences after initial consent has been given, providing ongoing granularity in terms of cookie settings. This could be achieved through a dedicated user interface within the website itself, allowing users to adjust their preferences as needed."

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented. (Partially Compliant) The policy presents an opt-in mechanism for the user to agree to the use of cookies, which aligns with GDPR's requirement for explicit consent. However, it does not offer a granular approach to allow users to accept specific types of cookies individually before they are set, as per GDPR recommendations.
   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism. (Partially Compliant) Users can manage their cookie preferences at any time through the ""Cookie settings"" option provided in the policy. However, there is no clear and immediate method to delete all previously-given consent.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. (Partially Compliant) Users are allowed to accept or reject different categories of cookies, but they cannot choose individual cookies within those categories.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? (Non-Compliant) As the policy does not allow users to consent to specific cookies, it fails to provide a fully granular control mechanism over cookies.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? (Partially Compliant) The policy mentions that data may be shared with third parties for marketing purposes. However, it does not provide sufficient details on specific third parties involved or the purpose of their involvement.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? (Partially Compliant) The purpose of using cookies is stated in general terms, but the policy does not clearly explain how the collected data will be used for personalized advertising and marketing purposes.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially Compliant] The consent mechanism provided is explicit, but it does not offer a granular approach to allow users to consent to specific cookies, which may be in violation of the GDPR requirement for clear and affirmative action from the user.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] The policy presents an opt-in mechanism for the use of cookies, but it does not provide a means to easily withdraw consent immediately or delete all previously-given consent, which may fall short of GDPR requirements.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. The policy fails to meet GDPR requirements in several key aspects, such as offering a granular approach to consents, providing sufficient details on third-party data sharing and data processing purposes, and ensuring users can easily withdraw their consent and delete all previously-given consent immediately.

7. Final Justification:
   - Clearly explain why the classification was chosen. The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements as it presents an opt-in mechanism for the use of cookies and allows users to manage their cookie preferences, but falls short in areas like providing a granular approach to consents, offering transparency on third-party data sharing and data processing purposes, and enabling easy withdrawal of consent.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Practical steps to enhance GDPR compliance. To improve compliance with GDPR, the following suggestions can be considered:
   - Allow users to accept or reject individual cookies within categories.
   - Provide more specific details on third-party data sharing and their roles in data processing.
   - Clearly explain how collected data will be used for personalized advertising and marketing purposes.

     - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism. (Partially Compliant): Users can revoke their consent by changing their settings in the ""Privacy Settings"" section at the bottom of the website. However, it is not explicitly clear that this option exists on the initial Cookie Policy page or during the initial consent request.
  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. (Partially Compliant): Users can choose between ""Allow All,"" ""Only Allow Necessary,"" and ""More Options."" However, in the ""More Options"" section, it is not immediately clear that users can customize their preferences for each type of cookie, only for processing purposes and providers.
     - Is granular control over cookies offered? (Partially Compliant): Users can choose to allow or deny specific processing purposes and providers, but they cannot select specific types of cookies.
  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? (Compliant): Yes, the Cookie Policy mentions 40 data processing providers by name. However, users may find it challenging to understand the specific purpose of each provider's data collection.
     - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? (Partially Compliant): The purpose of data processing is provided, but users might struggle to understand the specifics due to the technical jargon used in the Cookie Policy.
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant]: Users are given a clear and affirmative action to accept or reject cookies, which satisfies the definition of consent under GDPR.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant]: The policy provides users with clear information about the processing of their personal data and offers them choices regarding cookie settings. However, it is not explicitly stated that consent can be withdrawn at any time or the consequences of denying consent (e.g., limited functionality of the website).
  6. Critical Analysis:
     - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. The Cookie Policy does not clearly and unambiguously inform users about the consequences of accepting or refusing cookies, which is a requirement under Article 7(4) of the GDPR. Additionally, the consent withdrawal mechanism could be improved by making it more visible during the initial consent request.
  7. Final Justification: The Cookie Policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it offers users choices regarding cookie settings and provides clear information about data processing. However, it does not meet all requirements under GDPR, such as explicitly stating the consequences of accepting or refusing cookies and making the consent withdrawal mechanism more visible during the initial consent request.
  8. Improvement Suggestions: To improve compliance with GDPR, the Cookie Policy should be revised to explicitly state the consequences of accepting or refusing cookies, clearly indicate the consent withdrawal mechanism during the initial consent request, and provide a more granular control over specific types of cookies for users. Additionally, simplifying the language used in the policy might help users understand their rights and options more easily."
verbose_compliance,compliant,compliant-50.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Classification: Partially Compliant

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Explicit consent is given through the explicit affirmative action of clicking ""Accept all"". The mechanism is clear and easy to understand.
   - Users can easily withdraw consent by clicking on the ""Decline all"" button, which hides the consent details. However, since the cookies are already set upon loading the page without express consent, initial compliance may be questionable.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Users are not given a choice to select specific cookie types. The policy provides only two options: ""Accept all"" and ""Decline all"". However, granular control over cookies is offered by providing detailed information about the purpose of each type of cookie in the consent details.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed clearly in the policy, as it states that data may be passed on to service providers. The purpose of data processing is also transparent.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially Compliant] Since the user's consent is not requested before setting cookies, the initial collection and storage of information may not meet the GDPR requirement for ""prior"" consent. However, the policy does offer a mechanism to give or withdraw consent at any time.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] The condition that consent must be given freely, specifically, informed and unambiguously is partially met. Although users are provided with information about the data processing, they do not have a clear choice to select specific cookie types, which may lead to concerns over the specificity of their consent.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - The policy fails to meet GDPR requirements by setting cookies before obtaining user consent. This initial collection and storage of information without prior consent may be seen as a breach of Article 4(11) (Consent Definition). In addition, the option to decline all cookies does not provide granular control over the types of cookies being used.

7. Final Justification: The classification is Partially Compliant because, while users are given the ability to withdraw consent at any time and the policy provides clear information about data processing and third-party sharing, there are concerns regarding initial compliance with GDPR requirements for consent due to setting cookies before obtaining user consent.

8. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance GDPR compliance, it is recommended to:
   - Request user consent before setting any non-essential cookies to meet the requirement of ""prior"" consent in Article 4(11).
   - Provide a more granular control mechanism for users to select specific cookie types when giving their consent. This would align better with the GDPR requirement for explicit and informed consent (Article 7). Additionally, providing more detailed information about each type of cookie in the initial consent pop-up rather than directing users to the privacy policy could improve transparency."
verbose_compliance,compliant,compliant-6.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Classification: Partially Compliant

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Explicit consent is given through the user's active acceptance of cookies after reading the policy. However, it could be argued that ""accepting processing"" might not meet the threshold for freely given consent as per GDPR due to the default option being ""Accept Everything.""
   - Users can easily withdraw consent by accessing the Cookie Settings at the bottom of the page. This mechanism is clear and easy to use.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types, but the default option does not require explicit consent for each category. Therefore, it may not be fully compliant with granular control over cookies requirements.
   - The policy offers some granular control over cookies through the ""Save Selection"" and ""Decline"" options, but it could benefit from providing more detailed and easily understandable controls for users.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed clearly under the ""Options"" section and in the ""Data Processing Partners & Services"" section. However, the level of detail provided for each category could be improved to ensure that users fully understand the purpose and extent of data processing.
   - The purpose of data processing is transparent, as it explains that cookies are used to optimize the website and improve user experience.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy mentions explicit consent but fails to provide a clear opt-in mechanism for each category, making it Non-Compliant.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Although users can withdraw their consent at any time, the default option being ""Accept Everything"" might not meet the threshold of freely given consent as per GDPR requirements, making it Partially Compliant.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - The policy fails to provide a clear opt-in mechanism for each cookie category, which is essential for meeting the granular control over cookies requirements set by GDPR.
   - Although users are given the option to decline or save their selections, the default option being ""Accept Everything"" may not meet the threshold of freely given consent as per GDPR.

7. Final Justification:
   - The policy is Partially Compliant because it provides some transparency about data processing and offers users the ability to withdraw their consent at any time. However, it does not fully comply with the GDPR's granular control over cookies requirements and may not meet the threshold of freely given consent due to the default option being ""Accept Everything.""

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Make the default option ""Decline"" or provide a more balanced default setting that does not automatically accept all cookies.
   - Ensure that users can easily give explicit, granular consent for each category of cookie and that the policy is updated to provide clearer information about data processing purposes and third-party sharing.
   - Consider implementing an opt-in mechanism for each category of cookie rather than offering a default option or requiring users to manually deselect categories they do not want."

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented: Yes, the user is explicitly informed about the use of cookies and asked to give their consent before any data processing takes place. The cookie policy presents the purpose of data processing (improving user experience, personalizing content, optimizing ad performance) and allows users to adjust their preferences at any time.
   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism: Yes, users can easily withdraw their consent by changing their settings in the ""Privacy Settings"" section. They have the option to activate only necessary technologies or customize their preferences. This change takes effect immediately upon saving changes.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain: Yes, users are given granular control over cookies by allowing them to choose which specific cookie types they want to accept or reject. They can select from options such as ""Accept All,"" ""Activate Only Necessary Technologies,"" and ""Change Settings.""
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? Yes, users have the ability to adjust their preferences for each individual cookie type.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? Yes, the policy explains that data is shared with third parties such as Google Ads Conversion, AT Internet, Pinterest Ads, Tag Commander, YouTube, and Facebook Pixel for purposes like improving user experience, personalizing content, optimizing ad performance.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? Yes, the policy provides a clear explanation of why and how data is processed (improving user experience, personalizing content, optimizing ad performance).

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant] The policy explains that consent is voluntary, specific, informed, and unambiguous, which aligns with the definition provided in Article 4(11).
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] While users are clearly informed about their options and can easily withdraw their consent, it is not explicitly stated that they have the right to withdraw their consent at any time. However, the ability to change settings at any time implies this right is granted.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements: Although the policy provides users with a choice and explains why data is processed, it does not explicitly state that users have the right to withdraw their consent at any time as required by Article 7(3) of the GDPR. This oversight should be addressed to ensure full compliance with the regulation.

7. Final Justification:
   - Clearly explain why the classification was chosen: The policy presents users with clear information about the use of cookies, their options for managing them, and a mechanism for adjusting preferences or withdrawing consent. However, it does not fully comply with Article 7(3) of the GDPR by explicitly stating that users have the right to withdraw their consent at any time.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Practical steps to enhance GDPR compliance: Add a clear statement in the cookie policy explaining that users have the right to withdraw their consent at any time, and provide easy access to this function within the user interface or settings menu. Additionally, consider adding detailed explanations for each specific cookie type to improve transparency and understandability of data processing activities."
verbose_compliance,compliant,compliant-8.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Classification: Partially Compliant
   - The policy discloses the use of cookies and provides a choice to users, which partially complies with GDPR requirements. However, granular control over cookie types is offered but not explicit, as the number of cookies (e.g., 67 marketing cookies) may overwhelm users, making it challenging for them to understand their choices.
   - The unclassified cookies category shows that some cookies have not been adequately classified, which could potentially lead to a lack of transparency and control over data processing.

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented.
     - Explicit consent is given through the user clicking ""OK"" on the cookie banner. The policy clearly states that by doing so, users are consenting to the use of cookies.
   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism.
     - Users can easily revoke or change their consent by navigating to the Privacy Information section and modifying their preferences.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain.
     - Users are offered four categories of cookies (Necessary, Preference, Statistics, Marketing) but cannot explicitly choose individual cookies within those categories. This lack of granular control may not meet GDPR requirements for user consent to be specific, informed, and unambiguous.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered?
     - Users can select which cookie category they allow, but not individual cookies within these categories, which is not considered granular control under GDPR.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly?
     - Yes, the policy mentions that some cookies are placed by third parties appearing on the pages. However, more detailed information about specific third-party providers would further enhance transparency.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable?
     - The purposes for using cookies are generally disclosed (e.g., website functionality, improving user experience, displaying advertising). Still, providing a clearer explanation of each cookie category and their specific purposes could help users make informed decisions.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially Compliant + Reason]
     - The policy uses a form of consent, but it may not be unambiguous as users cannot explicitly select individual cookies within each category. This could lead to ambiguity about what specific data processing activities the user consents to.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant + Reason]
     - The policy provides information about the processing of personal data and offers a choice, but users do not have granular control over their choices. Therefore, while there is some level of transparency and user choice, it may not fully meet the GDPR requirement for explicit, informed, and unambiguous consent.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements.
     - Lack of granular control over individual cookies and excessive use of certain categories (e.g., marketing cookies) may make it difficult for users to understand their choices, potentially leading to a lack of informed consent. Additionally, some cookies remain unclassified, which could affect transparency.

7. Final Justification:
   - The classification is ""Partially Compliant"" because while the policy discloses the use of cookies and offers a choice to users, it does not fully meet GDPR requirements for granular control over individual cookie selections, unambiguous consent, and complete transparency about data processing activities.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To enhance GDPR compliance, consider offering more detailed information about the specific purposes of each cookie category and individual cookies within these categories, allowing users to make granular choices. Additionally, review and classify all unclassified cookies promptly to ensure transparency and user control over their data processing activities."

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Explicit consent is given through the user clicking either ""Allow all"", ""Only necessary allow"" or accessing the ""More options"". However, it could be improved by providing a more prominent and obvious way to give consent.
   - Users can easily withdraw their consent by accessing the Privacy Settings at the bottom of the website and changing their selections. This mechanism is clearly presented.
3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types as they have options for ""Allow all"", ""Only necessary allow"" or customize preferences in the ""More options"". However, granular control over cookies could be improved by providing more detailed options regarding which specific subservices of third-party providers they consent to.
   - The policy does offer some level of granular control over cookies through the ""More Options"" section, but it could be made more user-friendly and transparent.
4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed in the policy by listing the processing purposes & providers, as well as the subservices of each provider. However, it could be improved by providing a clearer explanation of what data is being shared, how it is used, and for which specific purposes.
   - The purpose of data processing is transparent to some extent through the explanations provided under the ""Processing Purposes & Providers"" section. However, it could benefit from a more understandable and accessible presentation.
5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy seems to comply with this article as it provides clear information about the processing of personal data and offers users the option to give or withdraw consent.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy generally complies with this article by providing a clear and accessible way for users to give and withdraw their consent. However, improvements could be made regarding the presentation and transparency of the information provided about data processing purposes and third-party sharing.
6. Critical Analysis:
   - One area where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements is in the level of granularity offered for consent options. Users might find it difficult to understand exactly which specific subservices they are consenting to when choosing ""Marketing Cookies"", for example.
7. Final Justification:
   - The classification as Partially Compliant was chosen because while the policy provides a mechanism for giving and withdrawing consent, there is room for improvement in terms of clarity, transparency, and granularity with regard to data processing purposes and third-party sharing.
8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To enhance GDPR compliance, the following steps could be taken:
   - Provide a more prominent and obvious way to give consent (e.g., using a checkbox instead of text links).
   - Offer users more detailed options for consenting to specific subservices of third-party providers.
   - Improve the presentation and transparency of information about data processing purposes and third-party sharing, making it easier for users to understand what they are consenting to.
   - Provide a clear explanation of how user data is being used, as well as for which specific purposes, in simple, accessible language."
verbose_compliance,non_compliant,non_Compliant-27.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented.
       The policy presents the use of cookies to users, but the presentation could be clearer and more explicit. It does not give a straightforward ""I agree"" or ""I disagree"" option for user choice. However, the consent can be withdrawn easily by closing the banner (though this might depend on the cookie settings in the user's browser).
     - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism.
       Users can withdraw their consent by closing the banner, effectively refusing cookies. While this may not be as straightforward as providing an ""I disagree"" button, it is still accessible and meets the GDPR requirement for easy withdrawal of consent.
  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain.
       Users are given the option to customize their choices within the settings, but they cannot choose specific cookie types as options are grouped into categories like technical, audience measurement, performance, functional, marketing, and all vendors.
     - Is granular control over cookies offered?
       Although users can customize their choices in the settings, they still don't have full granular control over each individual cookie type. Therefore, there is limited granularity when it comes to choosing specific cookies.
  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly?
       The policy provides some information about data sharing with third parties in the context of marketing purposes, but this disclosure could be clearer and more explicit. Users should have a better understanding of which specific third parties may access their data and for what purpose.
     - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable?
       The policy does provide some information about the purpose of data processing, but it may not be presented in a clear or easily understandable way for all users. Improvements could be made to make the language simpler and more straightforward.
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
       The policy does not explicitly state that users are providing their consent based on clear and specific information, which is a requirement under Article 4(11). To comply with GDPR, the policy should clearly specify that the user's consent is being given freely, specifically, informed, and unambiguously.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
       The policy does not meet all requirements of Article 7 as it doesn't ensure that the user's consent is obtained in an easily accessible form, with the default being a refusal to cookies. This can be improved by providing a clear ""I agree"" button and making sure the settings are not overly complex or hidden.
  6. Critical Analysis:
     - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements.
       The policy does not adequately inform users about data sharing with third parties, lacks clarity in its language, and does not provide a straightforward ""I agree"" button for explicit consent. It also fails to ensure that the default setting is a refusal of cookies to comply with Article 7.
  7. Final Justification:
     - Clearly explain why the classification was chosen.
       The policy is partially compliant because it allows users to withdraw their consent, provides settings to customize choices, and mentions the use of cookies in its privacy policy. However, it does not meet GDPR requirements for explicit, informed, specific, unambiguous, and freely given consent due to lacking clarity, not providing a straightforward ""I agree"" button, and not ensuring a default refusal to cookies.
  8. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Practical steps to enhance GDPR compliance.
       To improve the cookie policy's GDPR compliance, provide a clear ""I agree"" button for explicit consent, ensure that the default setting is a refusal of cookies, make the language simpler and more understandable, disclose third-party data sharing clearly, specify the purpose of data processing transparently, and offer granular control over specific cookie types."
verbose_compliance,non_compliant,non_compliant-1.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Explicit consent is given as users are informed about the use of cookies, their purpose, and third-party involvement (Article 5(1)(a)). However, opting out of personalized or non-personalized advertising seems unavoidable, which goes against the principle of user control under GDPR.
     - The withdrawal mechanism is not described in detail. While users can adjust cookie settings, it is stated that they cannot be adjusted once enabled, which contradicts the right to withdraw consent (Article 7(3)).
  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types, but not at an individual level. The policy offers three broad categories: essential, marketing, and statistical cookies, which does not meet the granularity requirement of GDPR (Article 7(4)).
     - Granular control over cookies is not offered as users cannot opt-out of personalized or non-personalized advertising, contradicting the principle of user control under GDPR.
  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed (Article 13/14), but clarity could be improved by providing specific details about each third party, their role, and the data shared.
     - The purpose of data processing is transparent in terms of the use of cookies for advertising, marketing, and website usage analysis. However, more information about how data will be used, processed, and stored should be provided to ensure transparency (Article 13/14).
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): Non-Compliant. Consent is not freely given since users cannot opt-out of personalized or non-personalized advertising, contradicting the requirement for unambiguous and specific consent under GDPR.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Non-Compliant. Users cannot withdraw their consent or select specific cookie types at an individual level, violating the user control principle under GDPR.
  6. Critical Analysis:
     - The policy fails to provide users with the right to choose and control their data processing through cookies, which is a key requirement of GDPR. Additionally, the lack of opt-out for personalized or non-personalized advertising contradicts the user's rights under GDPR.
  7. Final Justification:
     - The policy was classified as Partially Compliant because it provides some level of transparency about cookie usage and discloses data sharing with third parties but does not meet the granularity, consent withdrawal, or opt-out requirements under GDPR.
  8. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Offer users a granular choice when it comes to selecting specific cookies and allow them to opt-out of personalized advertising.
     - Provide detailed information about third parties, their roles, and the data shared with them in the cookie policy.
     - Amend the consent mechanism to ensure that users can easily withdraw their consent and make changes to their cookie preferences."
verbose_compliance,non_compliant,non_compliant-10.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Classification: Partially Compliant

    The cookie policy provides users with the ability to manage their preferences regarding cookies, which is a requirement under GDPR. However, it falls short in providing a comprehensive explanation of each category of cookie and the purpose of data processing. This may lead to confusion among users as they may not fully understand what they are consenting to.

   2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
      - Explicit consent is given when users click ""Accept & Close"" or choose their preferences under ""Cookie Settings."" However, it could be argued that the initial ""Accept & Close"" option does not provide clear and affirmative action as required by GDPR. A more explicit affirmation such as ""I accept cookies"" would be more compliant.
      - Users can easily withdraw consent by modifying their preferences under ""Cookie Settings."" This is clear and easy to understand, making it compliant with GDPR requirements.

   3. Granular Consent and Options:
      - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types as they can choose between ""Essential,"" ""Functional,"" and ""Marketing"" cookies. However, the policy does not offer granular control over each individual cookie within these categories, which could potentially be improved for better transparency and user understanding.
      - The policy does not currently provide granular control over each individual cookie; this is an area where it may fail to meet GDPR requirements.

   4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
      - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed, but the policy could benefit from more detailed explanations of how user data is shared with specific providers and services listed under each category (Essential, Functional, Marketing).
      - The purpose of data processing is generally transparent, but the lack of granular control over individual cookies may lead to a lack of understanding for some users about what specific pieces of information are being processed.

   5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
      - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy uses clear language and provides users with the ability to give or withdraw consent, making it partially compliant with this article. However, the initial ""Accept & Close"" option could be improved for more explicit affirmation of consent.
      - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy allows users to manage their preferences, but it lacks granular control over individual cookies, which may not meet the requirements for specific, informed and unambiguous consent as stated in this article.

   6. Critical Analysis:
       - The policy provides a basic mechanism for managing cookie preferences, but it could benefit from more detailed explanations of each category and individual cookies within them. This would help users understand exactly what they are agreeing to when they give their consent.
       - It is important to ensure that the initial ""Accept & Close"" option is updated to provide a more explicit affirmation of consent, as this may not currently meet GDPR requirements.

   7. Final Justification:
       - The policy is partially compliant with GDPR because it provides users with the ability to manage their cookie preferences and offers some transparency about data processing. However, it falls short in several areas, such as providing explicit consent, offering granular control over cookies, and clearly explaining how user data is shared with third parties.

   8. Improvement Suggestions:
       - Add more detailed explanations for each category of cookie and the individual cookies within them to improve transparency and user understanding.
       - Update the initial ""Accept & Close"" option to provide a more explicit affirmation of consent, such as ""I accept cookies.""
       - Offer granular control over individual cookies to meet requirements for specific, informed, and unambiguous consent under Article 7 of GDPR.
       - Consider adding a feature that explains how user data is shared with third parties to improve transparency."

       - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain.
         Users are provided with three main options: accept all cookies, reject unnecessary cookies, or manage cookie settings. However, they cannot choose specific cookie types within the ""Manage cookie settings.""
       - Is granular control over cookies offered?
         The policy offers some level of granularity as users can choose between accepting all cookies and only essential cookies, but not at an individual cookie type level.

   4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
       - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly?
         Yes, the policy mentions that some cookies may be used for personalized advertising and content delivery (targeting cookies), which might involve data transfer to third parties.
       - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable?
         The purpose of data processing is explained in a general sense, but it could be improved by providing clearer explanations about how user data will be used for each specific cookie type.

   5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
       - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
         The policy complies with Article 4(11) as it clarifies the nature, purpose and the potential consequences of consenting to non-essential cookies, including data transfer to the USA.
       - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
         The policy partially complies with Article 7 as it gives users control over their preferences regarding non-essential cookies and provides a clear mechanism for consent withdrawal. However, the policy does not fully meet granularity requirements in terms of allowing users to choose specific cookie types.

   6. Critical Analysis:
       - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements.
         The policy could improve by offering more granular control over non-essential cookies, providing clearer explanations about how user data will be used for each specific cookie type, and ensuring that users can choose specific cookie types within the ""Manage cookie settings"" option.

   7. Final Justification:
       - Clearly explain why the classification was chosen.
         The policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it allows users to manage their preferences regarding non-essential cookies, offers some transparency about data processing and third-party sharing, and provides a mechanism for consent withdrawal. However, it does not fully meet granularity requirements in terms of giving users a choice to select specific cookie types.

  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy appears to comply with this article as it relates to the definition of consent, as it offers clear choices and enables users to easily withdraw their consent.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy may be partially compliant with Article 7, as explicit prior consent is not obtained upon the first visit to the website. However, by providing options and allowing users to customize their preferences, it aligns with the spirit of obtaining clear, affirmative action.
  6. Critical Analysis:
     - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. One potential area for improvement is the delay in seeking explicit consent upon a user's first visit to the website, as this could be seen as violating the principle of transparency and user control over their data.

This may not meet GDPR's requirement for explicit consent as there seems no active affirmative action required from the user.
   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism. The policy does mention a mechanism for withdrawal of consent in the Privacy Policy and Cookie Notice, but it doesn't provide an easy or clear way to do so within the cookie banner itself.

   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? The policy describes the purpose of data processing to a certain extent but does not provide enough detail or clarity about how user data is used specifically for ad targeting purposes across Amazon services, making it less transparent.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy does not fully comply with GDPR's requirement of providing freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous consent for the processing of personal data. As previously mentioned, the method of obtaining consent is implicit rather than explicit.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy does not meet this condition as it does not ensure that the request for consent is presented in an easily accessible form, with the respective purposes for data processing attached to each consent option.

6. Critical Analysis:
The policy fails to meet several GDPR requirements by not offering granular control over cookies, lacking transparency in third-party data sharing and purposes of data processing, providing implicit rather than explicit consent, and not making it easy for users to withdraw their consent.

7. Final Justification: The classification is ""Partially Compliant"" as the policy partially meets GDPR requirements regarding data transparency and third-party sharing but fails in areas such as granular control over cookies, providing explicit consent, and offering an easy way for users to withdraw their consent.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly?
     - The policy lists all third-party services using cookies, including their respective purposes (e.g., Adobe Analytics for statistics, Google Ads for marketing). However, more information could be provided about each service's specific data processing practices to enhance transparency.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable?
     - The policy provides a clear explanation of the purposes of each type of cookie (Functional, Statistics, Marketing), but it may still be difficult for some users to fully understand the implications of their choices, especially when it comes to third-party services. More detailed explanations or links to external resources might be beneficial.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
     - The policy complies with Article 4(11) as it presents a clear and affirmative action for the user to give consent (i.e., by selecting their preferences).

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements.
     - Although the policy provides extensive information about cookie types and third-party services, it could improve by offering more detailed explanations of each service's specific data processing practices to ensure full transparency. Additionally, the policy could provide a simpler way for users to understand the implications of their choices regarding third-party services.

7. Final Justification:
   - The classification is ""Partially Compliant"" because while the policy provides clear options for consent and withdrawal, it could benefit from offering more detailed information about the data processing practices of third-party services.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To enhance GDPR compliance, the following suggestions can be implemented:
     - Offer additional explanations or links to external resources for each third-party service regarding their specific data processing practices.
     - Provide a simplified summary of how user choices will impact their experience on the website (e.g., what features they may lose if they decline certain cookies).

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types, but not all necessary cookies (e.g., essential cookies) can be declined without also declining functional cookies as they are bundled together.
   - Granular control over cookies is offered in the sense that users can choose from different categories of cookies. However, it lacks the ability to individually select specific third-party cookies within those categories.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed clearly as users are informed about the 203 third-party vendors that use cookies and similar technologies.
   - The purpose of data processing is transparent but may not be understandable for all users, especially when it comes to advanced features like precise geolocation data and device scanning & identification.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy seems to comply as consent is presented in an easily accessible manner, and users are informed about the specific purposes for which their personal data will be processed. However, it's not entirely clear if the language used meets the standard of ""clear and plain"" as required by the GDPR.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy appears to comply as users are given a clear and affirmative action option to either accept or decline cookies and can withdraw consent easily. However, it's not entirely clear if the language used meets the standard of ""prior to the processing"" as required by the GDPR.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - The policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements in terms of providing a clear and concise explanation of the purpose of data processing, especially for advanced features like precise geolocation data and device scanning & identification. Additionally, essential cookies cannot be declined without also declining functional cookies, which may not be compliant with the principle of transparency and user control over their personal data.

7. Final Justification:
   - The classification is ""Partially Compliant"" as while the policy provides users with choices regarding cookie preferences, it does not meet all requirements for consent under GDPR in terms of clarity and granularity.

They explain that first-party cookies are placed by the website itself or contracted service providers, while third-party cookies may be placed by other providers whose content is integrated into the website. The reader is informed that they can manage cookie settings via features on the website or through changing their browser settings. The text also mentions that some countries outside of the European Union (EU) may not provide a level of data protection equivalent to the EU, and that additional security measures have been implemented to ensure that cookie information is protected appropriately. Finally, if the reader gives consent to ""Analytics and Marketing Cookies,"" they are agreeing to the transfer and further processing of cookie information in countries outside of the extended EU.

   The author also includes options for the reader to accept selected cookies, reject them, or accept all cookies. However, it is not clear from the text what specific cookies fall under each category, nor is it specified what consequences may result from accepting or rejecting cookies. Additionally, while the author mentions that they can manage cookie settings via features on the website or through changing their browser settings, they do not provide instructions for how to do so.

   Overall, this text provides a good overview of cookies and their use on websites, but could benefit from more specific information about the consequences of accepting or rejecting cookies, as well as clear instructions for managing cookie settings."

   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy appears to be in compliance with Article 4(11), as it describes the processing of personal data for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes. However, it could be more explicit about stating that the user's consent is necessary for non-essential cookies.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy appears to be compliant with Article 7, as it provides clear and concise information about the use of cookies, the purpose of data processing, and the user's right to withdraw consent. However, it could improve by offering more granular control over non-essential cookies.

6. Critical Analysis:

Yes, the policy states that user data will be processed in countries outside the EU, including the USA, and that this data may be shared with third parties for various purposes (analysis, marketing, content personalization, social media interaction).
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? Yes, the purpose of data processing is clearly stated at the beginning of the policy.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially Compliant + Reason] The consent given here may be compliant with GDPR since it is specific, informed, and freely given. However, it could be improved by providing a more granular option for users to select individual services within each category.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant + Reason] Although users are provided with clear information about the processing of their data and have the ability to give or withdraw consent, there is room for improvement as users cannot currently select specific cookies or services within each cookie category.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. The policy does not provide granular control over individual cookies or services, which could lead to potential non-compliance with Article 7 and the need for granular consent. Additionally, users should have the ability to access and manage their cookie preferences more easily.

7. Final Justification:
   - The classification as ""Partially Compliant"" reflects that while the policy provides some necessary elements, such as explicit consent and a mechanism for withdrawal, it falls short in meeting GDPR requirements regarding granular consent and control over individual cookies or services.

8. Improvement Suggestions:

  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly?
       - Yes, some third-party service providers are listed under the ""Services"" section, but not all of them.
     - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable?
       - The policy provides a general purpose for data processing (improving website user-friendliness and performance), but it does not offer specific details about each third-party service provider's purpose.

  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
       - Non-compliant, as the initial visit may not qualify as an unambiguous action signifying consent due to no opt-out option being available.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
       - Partially compliant, as users are given the choice to manage their cookie settings but not given a granular choice over specific cookie types.

  6. Critical Analysis:
     - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements.
       - The initial visit may not constitute an unambiguous action signifying consent, as users cannot opt-out at this stage.
       - Users are not offered a granular choice over specific cookie types, only the option to agree to all or disable all cookies.

  7. Final Justification:
     - The policy is partially compliant with GDPR due to its provision of information, a mechanism for managing cookie settings, and third-party disclosure. However, it fails in areas such as explicit consent and granular control over cookies.

  8. Improvement Suggestions:
     - To improve compliance with the GDPR, Daimler Truck AG could provide an opt-out option upon first visit to clearly demonstrate initial consent. They could also offer users a more granular choice over specific cookie types within each category."

     - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types but are limited as the ""Marketing,"" ""Statistics,"" ""Personalized Ads,"" and ""Advertising and Success Measurement Using the IAB TCF"" options are pre-ticked, suggesting that they are enabled by default. There is no granular control over cookies offered inside the ""Adjust Option.""
  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Data sharing with third parties such as The Trade Desk Ltd., Virtual Minds GmbH, and Trakken GmbH is disclosed under ""Advertising Partners Involved"" section but is not clearly stated upfront or in a concise manner. The purpose of data processing is transparent, but users may find the details overwhelming or difficult to understand quickly.
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially Compliant] The consent is specific, informed, and given freely, but the pre-ticked options in the ""Adjust Option"" suggest that the user's initial choice may not be entirely active, which could potentially be a breach of this article.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Non-Compliant] The policy does not meet the requirement of providing the information about processing activities in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form, as users may find it difficult to understand their rights and choices due to the dense language used.
  6. Critical Analysis:
     - The policy fails to provide clear and concise explanations for data sharing with third parties and lacks granular control over cookies options. Moreover, the pre-ticked consent options in the ""Adjust Option"" may not meet the GDPR requirements of freely given consent.
  7. Final Justification:
     - The policy was classified as Partially Compliant due to providing explicit consent options but failing to meet the requirement for concise and easily accessible information, especially regarding third-party data sharing and granular control over cookies. The pre-ticked options in the ""Adjust Option"" also raise concerns about freely given consent.
  8. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Simplify the language used to make it more understandable for users.
     - Provide clear, concise explanations for data sharing with third parties and offer granular control over cookies options in the ""Adjust Option.""
     - Remove pre-ticked consent options or provide a way for users to easily deselect them upon entering the ""Adjust Option.""

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Explicit consent is given, as users are required to click on 'Accept all cookies' to proceed with the use of cookies listed in the cookie settings. This mechanism may not be considered fully explicit because it does not ask for agreement to each specific type of cookie.
   - Users can easily withdraw their consent by changing or revoking their selection in the ""Cookie Settings"" section. However, the default setting is 'Accept All Cookies,' which may not meet the GDPR's requirement for an active opt-in mechanism.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types within the ""Cookie Settings,"" but they can only choose between accepting all cookies or denying them. This does not offer granular control over cookies because users cannot choose individual cookies to accept or reject.
   - The policy does not seem to provide granular control over cookies, as users can only enable or disable entire categories of cookies rather than select specific ones.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed in the policy by listing the services (EQS IR Cockpit, Friendly Captcha, Usercentrics Consent Management Platform, Matomo, Podigee, SAP SuccessFactors, Siteimprove, YouTube Video, and ID to request consent data) that may process personal data. However, the purpose of data processing is not explicitly stated in this policy.
   - While some general purposes are mentioned (e.g., activating core functionality, serving relevant ads, analyzing usage behavior, etc.), more specific explanations for each third-party service could be provided to meet GDPR transparency requirements.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy provides a clear explanation of the definition of consent as users are asked to give their consent to use cookies, and this consent can be revoked or changed at any time. However, explicit, informed, and unambiguous agreement is not ensured since users do not have the option to accept or reject each specific cookie type.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy meets some but not all conditions for consent as required by GDPR. While users can revoke or change their consent, they cannot provide specific and informed agreement to the processing of personal data because there is no option to select individual cookies within the ""Cookie Settings"" section.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - The policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements in several areas, such as providing explicit and informed consent for each cookie type and offering granular control over cookies. Additionally, more transparency could be provided regarding the purpose of data processing for each third-party service listed in the policy.

7. Final Justification:
   - The classification is ""Partially Compliant"" because while the policy meets some GDPR requirements (e.g., providing a mechanism to revoke consent), it fails in other areas (e.g., obtaining explicit and informed consent for each cookie type, offering granular control over cookies).

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To enhance GDPR compliance, the policy could be updated to offer users an option to select individual cookies to accept or reject, providing more transparency about the purpose of data processing for each third-party service, and ensuring explicit and informed consent for each cookie type. Additionally, a more active opt-in mechanism (e.g., asking users to agree to specific cookies before they are enabled) could be implemented."

     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] Compliant: The information provided is clear, concise, transparent, intelligible, easily accessible, and written in clear and plain language. Users are also able to withdraw their consent at any time.
  6. Critical Analysis:
     - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements: Although the policy provides adequate information about cookies and data processing, it could be improved by including more specific details about each category of cookie, such as the types of personal data processed and the duration for which the data will be stored. Additionally, the policy does not explicitly state how long users will need to wait before their consent changes take effect, although this information is mentioned in a less prominent location.
  7. Final Justification: The classification was chosen as Partially Compliant because while the policy meets most GDPR requirements for cookie policies, there are areas where it could be improved to provide more detailed and transparent information about data processing.

   - Is granular control over cookies offered? No, there is no granular control over individual cookies; only specific cookie categories can be enabled or disabled.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? The policy mentions that third-party providers may set cookies on the site for enhanced functionality, personalization, and targeted advertising. However, it does not disclose whether user data may be transferred outside of the European Economic Area without an adequate level of data protection.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? The policy explains that cookies are used to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in marketing efforts. However, users may find it difficult to understand exactly how their data will be used in these processes.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]: The policy seems to comply with the definition of consent under GDPR, as it is specific, informed, and freely given by the user. However, there is a possibility that the presentation of consent may not meet GDPR requirements for clear and unambiguous consent.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]: The policy generally complies with the conditions for consent under GDPR, as it allows users to withdraw their consent at any time. However, there is a lack of transparency regarding the consequences of not accepting all cookies and the possibility that data may be transferred outside of the EEA without adequate protection.

6. Critical Analysis: The policy fails to meet GDPR requirements in several areas, including the clarity and prominence of consent presentation, granular control over individual cookies, transparency regarding data transfer with third parties, and providing a clear understanding of the purpose of data processing.

7. Final Justification: The classification was chosen as the policy meets some GDPR requirements, but it falls short in several areas that are crucial for effective compliance.

8. Improvement Suggestions: To improve GDPR compliance, the following steps could be taken:
   - Clearly explain the consequences of not accepting all cookies.
   - Provide granular control over individual cookies within the Cookies Settings.
   - Disclose transparently any data transfers with third parties outside the EEA and ensure adequate protection for user data.
   - Improve the presentation of consent to make it more noticeable, clear, and unambiguous."

     - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism: Users can withdraw their consent by accessing the ""more settings"" option and modifying their cookie preferences. They can choose to deny, accept all, or select specific categories of cookies.

  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain: Yes, users are provided with options to select specific categories of cookies (Marketing, Functional, Essential). However, the policy lacks granular control as it does not allow selecting individual cookies within each category.
     - Is granular control over cookies offered? The policy offers some level of granular control by allowing users to choose specific cookie categories, but it does not provide granular control over individual cookies within those categories.

  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? Yes, the policy mentions that third-party services (such as usercentrics, webtrekk, sprinklr, etc.) are used, but it does not provide sufficient detail on what specific data is shared and why.
     - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? The purpose of data processing is somewhat clear as it relates to enabling certain functions on the website (Marketing, Functional, Essential), but further explanation about the types of data processed would be beneficial for transparency purposes.

  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy uses the term ""consent"" in a way that generally aligns with Article 4(11), which defines consent as any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which they, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signify agreement to the processing of personal data relating to them.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy complies with Article 7 to some extent as it ensures that users are given clear information about cookies and are required to give their consent before any non-essential cookies are stored on their device. However, the lack of granular control over individual cookies may raise questions about the level of user choice in the consent process.

  6. Critical Analysis: The policy provides a basic level of compliance with GDPR requirements for cookie policies, but it could benefit from more detailed explanations about data sharing with third parties and the specific types of data processed. Furthermore, offering granular control over individual cookies would enhance user privacy choices.

  7. Final Justification: The policy is classified as partially compliant because while it ensures users are informed and give explicit consent for cookies, it lacks detail on data processing and offers only limited granular control over cookie settings.

  8. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance GDPR compliance, the policy should provide more detailed information about data sharing with third parties, offer granular control over individual cookies within each category, and rephrase the consent process to ensure users understand exactly what they are agreeing to when giving their consent."

     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy is partially compliant as while it offers a choice to users about the use of cookies, the initial presentation of consent could be more prominent and user-friendly to ensure that the information is accessible and understandable.

  6. Critical Analysis:
     - The policy does not clearly explain how long the data will be stored or whether anonymized data is being used.
     - The interface for managing cookie settings could be improved for a better user experience, making it easier for users to understand their options and make informed decisions.

  7. Final Justification:
     - The policy is partially compliant as it meets some of the requirements set out in GDPR, but there are areas where improvements can be made to ensure better transparency, understanding, and user control over data processing.

  8. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Provide clearer explanations about data storage periods and anonymized data usage.

  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types, as they can modify their preferences in the Cookie Settings section.
     - Some level of granular control over cookies is offered, as users can choose to accept or reject various categories of cookies (Required, Functional, Third-Party Services, Marketing). However, the ""Allow All"" option implies that all cookies are necessary for website functionality, which may not always be the case.
  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed in the policy text, stating that marketing cookies come from ""services from other companies (autonomous third-party providers)"".
     - The purpose of data processing is somewhat transparent, as it states that cookies are used to improve site navigation, analyze site usage, and support marketing efforts. However, more specific information about the types of data collected and how it is processed could be provided for greater transparency.
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy complies with this article, as it provides clear, unambiguous, and freely given consent options to the user.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy is partially compliant with this article, as users are informed about their right to withdraw consent and are provided with an easy-to-use mechanism for doing so. However, the initial notice could be improved to ensure it is easily accessible, intelligible, and specific.
  6. Critical Analysis:
     - The policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements in terms of providing a clear, concise, and user-friendly method for obtaining consent. This is especially true in the initial notice, which could be more explicit about what actions constitute consent and what the user's rights are.
  7. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant due to its lack of clarity in presenting the initial consent mechanism and providing a comprehensive overview of data processing purposes and third-party sharing.
  8. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Revise the initial notice to ensure it is easily accessible, intelligible, and specific about what actions constitute consent and what the user's rights are.
     - Provide more detailed information about the types of data collected, how they are processed, and with whom they may be shared in the policy text for greater transparency.
     - Offer a clear option for users to easily revoke their consent or manage their cookie preferences at any time, such as through an easy-to-find link in the site's footer or navigation menu."

     - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable?: The policy provides some information about the purpose of cookies but does not clarify the specific purposes for each type of cookie. (Partial Compliance)
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy does not appear to offer a valid form of consent as it doesn't provide clear, affirmative action from users and doesn't specify the exact purposes of data processing. (Non-Compliant)
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy fails to meet this requirement by not offering an easily accessible, granular method for consenting or withdrawing consent, nor does it explicitly inform users about their rights. (Non-Compliant)
  6. Critical Analysis: The cookie policy lacks clear information on the purposes of data processing, fails to offer a granular method for consenting and withdrawing consent, and doesn't disclose data sharing with third parties. These gaps in the policy could lead to significant issues when enforcing GDPR.
  7. Final Justification: The classification is Partially Compliant as the policy provides some information about cookies but falls short on several key aspects required for a GDPR-compliant cookie policy.
  8. Improvement Suggestions: To improve compliance with GDPR, the cookie policy should offer clear and explicit consent options, enable granular control over cookies, disclose data sharing with third parties, clearly explain the purpose of each type of cookie, and provide a mechanism for users to easily withdraw their consent.

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented: The policy presents the use of cookies with users' consent, but it does not explicitly state that the user has to take an active step to give their consent. This could be improved to make the act of giving consent more explicit.
     - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism: The policy mentions that users can revoke their consent ""with effect for the future."" However, it does not provide a clear mechanism or link within the cookie policy itself to do so. A more straightforward process should be implemented to ensure ease of withdrawal.
  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain: The policy only offers two options: ""only necessary cookies"" and ""accept all."" This does not provide users with the granular control over specific cookie types that GDPR requires.

  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? The policy mentions the involvement of ""companies involved and third-party providers"" but does not provide detailed information about which specific third parties are being used, what type of data is being shared, or for what purposes.
     - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? The purpose of data processing is partially clear as it states that cookies are used for ""analysis and performance,"" ""interest-based advertising,"" and ""individual marketing."" However, more specificity would be needed to meet GDPR's transparency requirements.
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Non-Compliant + Reason]: The policy does not explicitly require the user to take a clear and affirmative action to give consent, which is required by GDPR's definition of consent.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant + Reason]: The policy provides information about cookies and how they are used but lacks clarity on whether the information is concise, easily accessible, and using clear and plain language, as required by GDPR.

  6. Critical Analysis: The policy fails to meet GDPR requirements regarding explicit consent, granular control over cookies, and transparency in data processing and third-party sharing.
  7. Final Justification: The classification is Partially Compliant because while the policy mentions the use of cookies with users' consent and provides some information on data processing purposes, it does not meet GDPR requirements for explicit consent, granular control over cookies, and transparency in data processing and third-party sharing.
  8. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance GDPR compliance, the policy should make giving consent more explicit, offer granular control over specific cookie types, provide clear and concise information about data processing purposes and third-party involvement, and implement a straightforward process for revoking consent within the cookie policy itself. Additionally, consider using clear and plain language to ensure that users understand their options and the implications of their choices."

Although it's not granular control over each type of cookie, there is a choice between two main options.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? Users are given the ability to select ""Set preferences"" for more specific details and control. However, they are limited to choosing either essential cookies or all cookies (including third-party cookies), which doesn't offer granular control over each type of cookie.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? The policy discloses the data sharing with third parties in a relatively clear manner, but it may not be immediately apparent to some users that by choosing ""Accept all,"" they are consenting to this data sharing.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? The purposes of data processing are described clearly in the policy, focusing on improving user experience, measuring performance, delivering personalized shopping experiences, and personalized advertising.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially Compliant] The policy provides a clear choice for users to accept or deny the use of cookies, which aligns with the consent definition in GDPR. However, the ""Accept all"" option may not fully meet the requirements as it includes data sharing with third parties, which could be perceived as ambiguous.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] The policy meets some conditions of Article 7 by providing clear and easily accessible information about cookies, their purposes, and the options to accept or deny them. However, the ""Accept all"" option does not meet the requirement for specific and informed consent when sharing data with third parties.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements: The policy lacks clarity in disclosing the implications of choosing the ""Accept all"" option, as it includes data sharing with third parties, which may not be apparent to all users. This could potentially breach Article 4(11) and Article 7 of the GDPR.

7. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it offers a choice for users to accept or deny cookies and provides a mechanism for withdrawing consent. However, it fails to meet all requirements by not being fully transparent about data sharing with third parties when choosing the ""Accept all"" option.

8. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance GDPR compliance, the policy should clearly disclose the implications of choosing the ""Accept all"" option, making sure users are well-informed about any potential data sharing with third parties. This will help to meet the requirements under Article 4(11) and Article 7 of the GDPR. Additionally, providing more granular control over different types of cookies may also improve compliance."

     - Clearly explain the purpose of data processing, including what exact data is being collected and how it is being used, in a way that is transparent and understandable to users."
verbose_compliance,non_compliant,non_compliant-43.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Classification: Partially Compliant
   - The policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it provides information about the use of cookies and gives users an option to manage their cookie preferences. However, it lacks a clear explanation on how data collected through cookies is used for each specific type of cookie (performance or marketing), which is required for transparency.

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Explicit consent is given as users are presented with two options: ""Allow all"" or ""Reject optional cookies."" The mechanism for withdrawing consent is also present, allowing users to manage their cookie preferences at any time.

  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types, but the policy does not clearly explain what each type of cookie (performance or marketing) entails and how they impact user privacy. Therefore, it is not entirely clear if granular control over cookies is offered.

  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - The policy discloses that data may be shared with third parties for performance and marketing purposes, but the specific details about these third parties are not provided, which falls short of the transparency requirements set by GDPR.
     - Although the purpose of data processing is mentioned, it lacks clarity as it does not specify how each type of cookie contributes to this purpose.

  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy partially complies as it provides an option for users to give or withdraw their consent, but the consent is not freely given since users cannot access the website without agreeing to cookies. This makes it challenging to demonstrate that the user's consent was truly informed and specific.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy does not fully comply with Article 7 as users are not provided with clear, concise, and easily accessible information about the types of personal data processed for each cookie purpose, making it difficult to understand their implications on privacy.

  6. Critical Analysis:
     - The policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements by not providing sufficient transparency regarding the use of cookies, the third parties with whom data is shared, and the specific purposes for which personal data is processed. Additionally, obtaining user consent in a manner that truly respects their rights and ensures that it is freely given could be improved.

  7. Final Justification:
     - The policy was classified as Partially Compliant because it provides some necessary elements required by the GDPR, but it lacks clarity in certain areas, particularly regarding transparency and user consent.

  8. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Enhance the policy to provide clear explanations for each type of cookie (performance or marketing) and specify the third parties with whom data may be shared.
     - Clarify the purpose of data processing for each type of cookie and ensure that users can freely give their informed consent without any impact on their ability to access the website. Additionally, make the policy more easily accessible by placing it in a prominent location on the website."
verbose_compliance,non_compliant,non_compliant-44.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Classification: Partially Compliant

    The cookie policy provides some GDPR-compliant elements but lacks specificity in certain areas, such as granular control over cookies and a fully transparent explanation of data processing purposes.

   2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
      - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented.
          The policy presents explicit consent through the ""Accept Everything"" button, which allows users to accept all cookie types.

      - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism.
          Users can easily withdraw their consent by accessing the ""Cookie Settings"" (fingerprint icon in the lower left corner of the screen) and changing their decision at any time. However, it is not clear how the withdrawal affects past data processing.

   3. Granular Consent and Options:
      - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain.
          Users can choose specific cookie categories (Comfort, Statistics/Range Measurement, Necessary) but are not presented with individual options for each tracking technology used.

      - Is granular control over cookies offered?
          The policy does not offer a granular level of control over individual cookies or tracking technologies used on the website.

   4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
      - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly?
          Data sharing with Google for analytical purposes is disclosed, but there is no clear disclosure regarding other third-party services integrated into the website.

      - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable?
          The purpose of data processing (improving the quality of the website) is mentioned, but it could be more detailed to help users fully understand how their data is being used.

   5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
      - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
          The policy seems to comply with this article as it provides clear information about the use of cookies and allows users to give or withdraw their consent.

      - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
          The policy partially complies with Article 7, as it offers a method for users to accept or decline the use of cookies. However, it does not meet the full granularity requirement for giving specific consent to each processing operation.

   6. Critical Analysis:
      - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements.
          The policy lacks transparency regarding the specific tracking technologies used on the website and does not offer a granular level of control over these technologies, potentially failing to meet the GDPR's requirement for clear and concise information and user choice.

   7. Final Justification:
      - Clearly explain why the classification was chosen.
          The policy is partially compliant because it offers some transparency and a method for users to accept or decline cookies, but it fails to meet the GDPR's requirements for granular control over tracking technologies and clear disclosure of data processing purposes and third-party sharing.

   8. Improvement Suggestions:
      - Practical steps to enhance GDPR compliance.
          To improve GDPR compliance, the website could offer a more detailed explanation of its data processing activities, provide granular control over individual tracking technologies used, and clearly disclose any third-party services integrated into the website. Additionally, the policy should be updated to ensure that users are informed about their right to withdraw consent and the potential risks associated with data processing in the USA (as stated for Google Analytics)."

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented: Yes, users are explicitly informed that the website uses cookies and they are asked to accept them. However, the policy does not clearly indicate if the use of cookies is strictly necessary for the site's operation or not.
   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism: Users can modify their cookie preferences at any time by clicking on the 'Cookie Settings' button and adjusting their choices. This makes it easy to withdraw consent, although it would be more user-friendly if there was a simple way to revoke all consent at once.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain: Yes, users can choose which types of cookies they allow (Necessary, Preferences, Statistics, Marketing). However, it is not clear if the ""necessary"" category includes only strictly necessary cookies or also functional ones.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? Users are given a reasonable level of control over their cookie settings.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? Yes, users are informed that data will be shared with social media, advertising, and analytics partners. However, more specific details about these partners would make the policy more transparent.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? The purpose of data collection is somewhat clear (to personalize content, ads, provide social media features, and analyze traffic), but the policy could be improved by providing more detailed explanations for each type of cookie.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] Compliant - The cookie policy uses clear and affirmative action to obtain user consent, as required by GDPR for consent to be valid.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] Partially Compliant - While users are informed about the processing of their personal data and given a choice, the policy could do more to ensure that consent is freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. For example, making it clear whether ""necessary"" cookies are strictly necessary or not would help meet this requirement.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements: The policy could be improved by providing more specific details about data sharing with third parties and the purposes of data processing for each type of cookie. Clarifying whether ""necessary"" cookies are strictly necessary or not would help ensure that users have a clear understanding of what they are consenting to.

7. Final Justification:
   - Clearly explain why the classification was chosen: The policy is partially compliant because it provides some level of transparency and allows users to modify their cookie preferences, but could benefit from more detailed explanations and clarifications to ensure full compliance with GDPR requirements.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Practical steps to enhance GDPR compliance: The policy should be updated to clearly indicate whether ""necessary"" cookies are strictly necessary or not, provide more specific details about data sharing with third parties, and offer a more user-friendly way to revoke all consent at once. These improvements would help ensure that the policy fully complies with GDPR requirements and provides users with a clear understanding of their cookie choices."

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented: Yes, the policy presents clear information about the use of cookies and requires user consent for non-essential cookies. However, the mechanism can be improved by providing a more prominent notice that clearly identifies the types of cookies being used and the purpose of data processing.
     - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism: Yes, users can revoke or change their consent at any time through the Privacy Preference Center. However, the policy does not explicitly mention how this will affect past interactions or data collected before the withdrawal of consent.
  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. Yes, users can select specific categories of cookies (Necessary, Performance, Marketing) through the Privacy Preference Center. However, it may not be clear to users that selecting 'Agree' enables all non-essential cookies, while 'Deny' only allows essential cookies.
     - Is granular control over cookies offered? Yes, but there is room for improvement in terms of providing more detailed information about the specific cookies being used and their purposes.
  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? Somewhat clear, as the policy mentions data transfers to countries outside the EU without an adequate level of data protection, but it does not list specific third-party service providers being used.
     - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? Yes, the purpose of using cookies is generally explained, but more detailed information about each specific cookie could be provided for greater transparency.
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] Compliant, as the policy requires explicit user consent to process non-essential cookies and provides a simple means for users to withdraw or change their consent. However, the mechanism could be improved by providing more detailed information about the types of cookies being used and their purposes.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] Compliant, as the policy provides clear information about the processing of personal data and offers users a choice to consent or not, with the option to change or revoke their consent at any time.
  6. Critical Analysis: The policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements by not providing sufficient detail about the specific cookies being used, their purposes, and the third-party service providers involved in the data processing. This lack of transparency could make it difficult for users to fully understand the implications of their consent decisions.
  7. Final Justification: The policy was classified as Partially Compliant because it meets most GDPR requirements but could benefit from improvements in terms of providing more detailed information about the cookies being used and the third-party service providers involved in data processing. This would help users make informed decisions about their consent and ensure that they are fully aware of how their personal data is being processed.
  8. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance GDPR compliance, the policy could be revised to include more detailed information about each specific cookie (e.g., name, purpose, third-party provider), along with clear explanations of the purposes for which user data will be processed and the implications of consent decisions. Additionally, users should be informed of how their past interactions or data collected before the withdrawal of consent will be affected when they choose to revoke or change their consent."
verbose_compliance,non_compliant,non_compliant-47.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Classification: Partially Compliant
  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
      - Explicit consent is given through the checkboxes 'Deny' and 'AGREE'. The policy clearly explains the consequences of each choice ('Enjoy a personalized experience with SIXT...', 'continue solely with technologies that are essentially required for this website.'). Users can easily withdraw consent by modifying settings or using the link “Cookie settings” in the footer of the website.
  3. Granular Consent and Options:
      - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types under the 'Categories' section (Marketing & Analytics, Essential). However, the granular control over cookies could be improved as it only offers an option to enable or disable all cookies of a particular category rather than individual cookies within that category.
  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
      - The policy discloses data sharing with third parties (names of partners mentioned under 'Categories'). However, the purpose of data processing is not explicitly stated for each cookie or service.
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
       - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially Compliant] The policy presents a free choice and explains the consequences of the choices given, which meets part of the requirement. However, users do not have a clear explanation of what specific personal data will be processed and for what purpose for each category of cookies.
       - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] The policy presents the information in an intelligible and easily accessible form, but the consent is not given in a manner which is clear and distinguishable from other matters, as required by GDPR (Article 7(4)).
  6. Critical Analysis:
      - The policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements due to the lack of explicit and detailed information about the specific personal data that will be processed for each category of cookies and the purpose of such processing. The users should have a clear understanding of what they are consenting to.
  7. Final Justification:
      - The classification is Partially Compliant because while the policy presents an opportunity to give explicit consent and withdraw it, it lacks transparency about the specific personal data being processed and the purpose of such processing for each category of cookies.
  8. Improvement Suggestions:
      - Provide more detailed information about the specific personal data that will be processed for each category of cookies and the purpose of such processing. This would help users make informed decisions and clearly understand what they are consenting to.
      - Offer granular control over individual cookies within each category rather than just enabling or disabling an entire category.
      - Ensure the presentation of consent meets GDPR requirements by presenting it in a manner that is clear, concise, and distinguishable from other matters."

   - The policy provides some information about the types of cookies used, but it does not provide a comprehensive list as required by GDPR Article 13(2)(c).

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented.
     - The policy presents an option for users to accept only essential cookies, but the other options (Analytics & Performance, External content) are set to 'accept all' by default. This could be considered as non-explicit consent since the user has not actively given their agreement to these types of cookies.
   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism.
     - Users can easily withdraw their consent by clicking on the ""ACCEPT ONLY ESSENTIALS"" button, which resets all cookie preferences to only essential cookies. However, this does not explicitly state that it will delete existing cookies or prevent them from being set in the future, which is necessary for full GDPR compliance.

  3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain.
     - Users are only given an option to accept all cookies (including analytics & performance and external content) or only essential cookies. They do not have the ability to select specific types of cookies. This could be considered non-compliant with GDPR Article 7(4), which requires users to give their consent for each specific purpose of processing.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered?
     - Users are given two options: accept all cookies or only essential cookies, but they do not have the ability to select specific types of cookies. This does not offer granular control over cookies as required by GDPR.

  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly?
     - The policy mentions that external content is used on the website to provide additional information, but it does not specify which third parties are involved or what data is shared. This could be considered non-compliant with GDPR Article 13(2)(f), which requires controllers to provide information about the recipients or categories of recipients of personal data.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable?
     - The purposes of data processing (improving user experience, analytical tracking, associated cookies, improving overall performance) are generally described, but they could be more specific and easy to understand for an average user. This could be considered non-compliant with GDPR Article 12(1), which requires that personal data should be processed in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject.

  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Non-Compliant + Reason]
     - The policy does not provide an option for users to give explicit and informed consent for each specific purpose of processing their data, which is a requirement under GDPR Article 4(11).
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant + Reason]
     - Users are given the choice to accept all cookies or only essential cookies, but they do not have granular control over specific types of cookies. This could be considered non-compliant with GDPR Article 7(4), which requires that consent should be distinct from other matters and provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form.

  6. Critical Analysis:
   - The policy fails to meet GDPR requirements because it does not provide a comprehensive list of cookies, users are not given granular control over specific types of cookies, and data sharing with third parties is not disclosed clearly. Additionally, the consent mechanism could be improved to ensure that it is explicit, informed, and easily withdrawn.

  7. Final Justification:
   - The policy was classified as Partially Compliant because it provides some information about the types of cookies used but fails in several key areas such as granular control over specific types of cookies, disclosure of data sharing with third parties, and explicit consent for each specific purpose of processing personal data.

  8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To enhance GDPR compliance, the policy should be updated to provide a comprehensive list of all cookies used on the website, offer granular control over specific types of cookies, clearly disclose any data sharing with third parties, and ensure that users give explicit consent for each specific purpose of processing their personal data. The withdrawal mechanism could also be improved to explicitly state that it will delete existing cookies or prevent them from being set in the future."

  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? The policy mentions ""partners"" but does not specify who these partners are or what specific data they receive, making the disclosure insufficient.
     - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable?: The purpose of data processing is stated as improving user experience on the website and optimizing marketing activities, which is clear. However, more details about how this data is used could be provided to improve transparency.

  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy does not clearly state that the consent is ""specific, informed and freely given,"" which is a requirement under Article 4(11). This means that while users can manage their cookie preferences, they don't explicitly give separate consent for each type of cookie.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy does not offer a clear choice to reject non-essential cookies, which is incompatible with the conditions stated in Article 7.

  6. Critical Analysis:

The ""More Options"" section allows users to customize their preferences for different processing purposes and providers.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered?: Yes, although it could be more user-friendly as providing so many options might overwhelm some users.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? Yes, the policy explicitly mentions that third-party providers collect and process personal data (e.g., IP address, visit/product data) for various purposes such as statistical analysis, relevant content, and personalized advertising. A list of data processing providers is also provided.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? Yes, the policy explains in detail the purposes for which user data will be processed, including website reliability, statistical analysis, providing relevant content, and personalized advertising.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:

   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] While users have to actively give consent and can easily withdraw it, there is room for improvement in terms of making the policy more concise, easy-to-understand, and user-friendly to ensure that the information is presented in an accessible manner for all users.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements: The policy seems to meet most of the GDPR requirements regarding consent, transparency, and data subject rights. However, the policy might be difficult for some users to understand due to its complexity, potentially making it non-compliant with Article 12 (right to information) as the information provided may not be concise, transparent, intelligible, or easily accessible.

7. Final Justification:
   - Clearly explain why the classification was chosen: The policy is partially compliant because it does provide a mechanism for users to give and withdraw consent, and data sharing with third parties is disclosed clearly. However, there is room for improvement in terms of making the policy more concise, easy-to-understand, and user-friendly to ensure compliance with Article 12.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Practical steps to enhance GDPR compliance:
     a) Simplify the language used and structure the policy in an easier-to-understand format.
     b) Provide a brief summary of key points at the beginning of the policy, with links to more detailed information for users who wish to learn more.

[Partially Compliant] While users can change their cookie settings at any time, the mechanism for doing so is not clearly presented in a simple and straightforward manner. The ""Change Settings"" button does provide granular control over cookies, but it may not be immediately apparent to all users that this option exists or how to use it.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. [Partially Compliant] Users are provided with options to accept all cookies, activate only necessary technologies, or customize their preferences. However, the granular control over specific cookie types (e.g., Google Ads Conversion, Facebook Pixel) may not be immediately apparent due to the complexity of the settings interface.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? [Partially Compliant] Users can adjust their preferences for various cookie categories and third-party services like YouTube, Google Ads Conversion, etc., but the options could be presented in a more user-friendly manner.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? [Compliant] The policy provides clear information about the use of third-party services like YouTube, Google Ads Conversion, and Web Analysis Tool: AT Internet.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? [Partially Compliant] While the policy explains the general purposes for which user data is processed, such as personalizing the website and supporting marketing activities, it does not offer specific details about the types of data being collected, how long it will be stored, or the legal basis for each processing activity.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Non-Compliant] The policy does not provide a valid legal basis for the processing of personal data under Article 4(11). Consent should be specific, informed, and unambiguous. In this case, users are required to consent to their data being processed in the USA, which may pose a risk of access by US authorities.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] The policy complies with some aspects of Article 7, such as providing information about the processing purposes and users' ability to withdraw consent. However, it fails to meet the requirement for a valid legal basis under Article 4(11).

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. The policy falls short in several key areas, such as providing specific information about data processing activities, offering granular control over cookies in a user-friendly manner, and ensuring a valid legal basis for data processing under Article 4(11).

7. Final Justification:
   - Clearly explain why the classification was chosen. The policy is partially compliant with GDPR requirements due to its transparency regarding cookie usage, users' ability to adjust their preferences, and disclosure of third-party data sharing. However, it does not meet all the GDPR standards for specificity, granular control over cookies, valid legal basis for data processing, and user-friendly withdrawal mechanisms.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Practical steps to enhance GDPR compliance include simplifying the cookie settings interface, providing more specific information about data processing activities (e.g., types of data collected, storage duration), offering granular control over individual cookies, ensuring a valid legal basis under Article 4(11), and improving the mechanism for users to withdraw their consent."

   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? Yes, the policy mentions specific third-party providers for each type of cookie, but it doesn't specify the purpose or nature of the data shared with them.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? The policy provides a general explanation of the purposes of data processing (website functionality, statistical evaluations, content personalization, advertising), but users might find it difficult to understand the specific implications of their choices due to the lack of detailed information.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant] The policy provides a clear choice between accepting or rejecting the use of cookies, thus meeting the GDPR requirement for explicit consent.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] While users are informed about the purposes of data processing and can easily withdraw their consent, it's not immediately obvious how to do so without visiting the Privacy Settings page. Moreover, the level of granularity in the consent options may be insufficient to ensure users fully understand and control the extent of data processing.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. The policy could benefit from providing more detailed information about the data shared with third parties, as well as allowing users to disable individual subservices within a provider. It should also make it easier for users to revoke their consent and clearly indicate this option on the cookie banner.

7. Final Justification:
   - The policy is partially compliant because it provides a choice for users to accept or reject cookies, but it lacks transparency in certain areas such as third-party data sharing and granular control over cookies.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To enhance GDPR compliance, the policy could offer more detailed explanations about the purposes of data processing and the data shared with third parties. It should also make it easier for users to revoke their consent by providing a clear option on the cookie banner. Additionally, allowing users to disable individual subservices within a provider would provide greater control over their data."

However, within the marketing category, there are numerous third-party services listed, but no option for selecting individual services within this category.
    - Is granular control over cookies offered? Partially Compliant: Users can select between essential and non-essential cookies, but not all non-essential cookies offer a choice to opt out individually.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
    - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? Yes, the policy explains that personal data and cookies may be used for both personalized and non-personalized advertising, shared with third parties (advertisers), and used by them to display ads relevant to user interests. However, more detail on specific purposes of data processing could be provided.
    - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? Partially Compliant: The policy provides some information about the purpose of data processing but could benefit from additional clarity and specificity for each category (essential, marketing, statistical).

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented. (Compliant): The policy presents clear options for users to accept or deny cookies, including a choice to manage cookie preferences through the ""Cookie Settings"" option. This is an explicit form of consent.
   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism. (Partially Compliant): Users can modify their cookie preferences at any time by clicking on the ""Cookie Settings"". However, it's unclear whether changing these settings stops previously collected data from being used. To fully comply with GDPR, a clear and straightforward withdrawal process should be provided for users to revoke their consent effectively.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. (Compliant): Users can select specific categories of cookies (Essential, Functional, Marketing) that they accept or deny. This provides a granular level of control over cookies.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? (Partially Compliant): While users can manage their cookie preferences, it's unclear if the withdrawal process extends to previously collected data from the selected cookies. To meet GDPR requirements fully, any revoked consent should result in the deletion of related data.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? (Compliant): The policy lists the providers for each category of cookie, making the data sharing clear.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? (Compliant): The categories of cookies are described in a way that is relatively easy to understand, although it may be beneficial to provide more detailed explanations for each provider.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:

However, it's unclear if the withdrawal process extends to previously collected data from the selected cookies. To fully comply with Article 4(11), any revoked consent should result in the deletion of related data.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant]: The policy presents a clear choice between accepting all processing, functional cookies only, and customizing preferences. However, as mentioned earlier, it's unclear if the withdrawal process extends to previously collected data from the selected cookies. To fully comply with Article 7, any revoked consent should result in the deletion of related data.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements: The main area where this policy might not fully meet GDPR requirements is in the withdrawal process for previously collected data. To ensure compliance, it's essential that a clear and straightforward mechanism for revoking consent results in the deletion of related data.

7. Final Justification:
   - Clearly explain why the classification was chosen: The policy presents clear options for users to accept or deny cookies, which meets the definition of consent under GDPR. However, it's unclear if the withdrawal process extends to previously collected data from the selected cookies, which is a crucial aspect of GDPR compliance. Therefore, I classified this policy as ""Partially Compliant.""

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Practical steps to enhance GDPR compliance: To improve compliance with GDPR, it would be beneficial to clarify the withdrawal process for previously collected data and ensure that any revoked consent results in the deletion of related data. Additionally, providing more detailed explanations for each provider within the ""Cookie Settings"" could help users better understand the purpose of data processing."

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Explicit consent is given, as users are presented with three options to choose from based on their preferences.
   - Users can easily withdraw consent by accessing the cookie settings at any time via the Cookie Policy and revoking their consent. The policy provides a clear mechanism for this.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types. They can choose between accepting all cookies, only essential cookies, or customizing their preferences by selecting which non-essential cookies to accept.
   - The policy offers granular control over cookies since users have the option to individually select which non-essential cookies to accept.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed clearly, as it is mentioned that consenting to non-essential cookies also agrees under Art. 49 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a GDPR that data may be processed in the USA.
   - The purpose of data processing is transparent and understandable as users are informed about why their data might be processed when they accept non-essential cookies. However, it could be improved by explicitly stating the purposes for each type of cookie (e.g., performance, functional, targeting).

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy is partially compliant as it mentions consent under GDPR (Art. 49 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a) when users agree to non-essential cookies. However, the explicit and informed nature of this consent could be further clarified for full compliance.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy is compliant as it provides clear information about data processing, allows users to give and withdraw their consent easily, and offers granular control over cookie settings.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - While the policy does provide choices and transparency about data processing, there's room for improvement in communicating the purposes of each type of cookie more clearly to ensure users fully understand the implications of their choices. The policy could also explicitly inform users that they can withdraw consent at any time without needing a specific reason.

7. Final Justification:
   - The classification is partially compliant because while the policy does provide choices and transparency about data processing, it could be improved in communicating the purposes of each type of cookie more clearly and explicitly informing users that they can withdraw consent at any time without needing a specific reason.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Clearly state the purposes for each type of cookie (e.g., performance, functional, targeting) to ensure users fully understand the implications of their choices.
   - Explicitly inform users that they can withdraw consent at any time without needing a specific reason and reiterate this information throughout the policy and cookies banner."

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Explicit consent is given as users are presented with options to accept or reject all cookies, or customize their preferences. However, the ""Accept All"" option might not always meet the standard of informed and unambiguous consent due to its placement at the top of the options without clear explanation of what it implies.
     - Users can easily withdraw consent by changing their cookie preferences or by using the ""Reject all"" option, but there's no immediate notice about the change in status once they do so.
  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types, with options for functional, advertising, and customizing their preferences. This provides some level of granular control over cookies.
     - There is granular control over cookies offered through the ""Manage settings"" option, but it could be improved by making the options more user-friendly and accessible.
  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - The purpose of data processing is disclosed, as it states that cookies are used for error-free operation, analysis, user-friendliness enhancements, and advertising purposes. However, the details about third-party sharing could be more explicit to improve transparency.
     - Data sharing with third parties is not explicitly stated; only the use of advertising cookies (which may involve third-parties) is mentioned. A clear disclosure about data sharing would help meet GDPR requirements.
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy complies with this article, as it provides clear and specific information about the use of cookies, and offers users a choice to consent or reject them.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Partially Compliant, as while the policy allows users to withdraw their consent by changing cookie preferences, there's no immediate notice about the change in status once they do so, which may not meet the GDPR requirement for easy withdrawal of consent.
  6. Critical Analysis: The policy misses opportunities to improve its compliance with GDPR by providing clearer disclosures regarding data sharing with third parties and offering more user-friendly options for managing cookie preferences. Additionally, the ""Accept All"" option might not meet the standard of informed and unambiguous consent.
  7. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant as it offers users a choice to accept or reject cookies, but could improve its compliance with GDPR by providing clearer disclosures about data sharing and making the options for managing cookie preferences more user-friendly.
  8. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance GDPR compliance, consider adding clear explanations next to each cookie category (functional, advertising) to help users understand their purpose, improving the design of the ""Manage settings"" section for better user experience, disclosing data sharing with third parties, and ensuring that the withdrawal of consent is immediately reflected in the user's status."

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented. (Compliant): The policy clearly informs users about the use of cookies, presents options for managing consent, and the 'Accept All' option only grants access after explicit user consent is obtained.
   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism. (Partially Compliant): While the policy provides a mechanism to change cookie settings, it does not explicitly state that users can withdraw their consent entirely. A clear statement indicating that users can fully withdraw their consent and the implications of doing so would be necessary for full compliance.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. (Compliant): The policy offers granular control over various cookie types, allowing users to choose between 'Only Required', 'Accept All', and custom settings through the 'Settings' option.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? (Partially Compliant): Although users can select specific cookie types, it is not possible to grant or deny access to third-party cookies specifically. This may require further refinement for full GDPR compliance.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? (Compliant): The policy mentions that major partners (excluding some minor ones) use cookies, but the specific third-parties involved are not explicitly listed as required by GDPR. Providing a clear and accessible partner list is necessary for full compliance.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? (Partially Compliant): The purposes of using cookies for analytics and marketing are stated, but further details about how this information will be used and potential consequences may be needed to meet GDPR requirements.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially Compliant + Reason]: The policy mentions that cookies require consent, but it does not explicitly state that this consent must be ""specific, informed and unambiguous."" Although the options provided seem to meet these criteria, a clear statement affirming GDPR compliance would strengthen the policy.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant + Reason]: The policy provides information on how to withdraw consent, but it does not explicitly state that users must be informed about their right to withdraw consent ""as easily as they gave it."" Further emphasis on this point could improve the policy's compliance with Article 7.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. (1) Lack of a clear partner list, (2) potential unclarity about the purpose and implications of data processing, (3) no explicit statement confirming GDPR compliance, and (4) insufficient emphasis on users' right to withdraw consent easily.

7. Final Justification: The policy partially complies with GDPR requirements due to its presentation of options for managing cookies, but there are areas where it could be improved, such as providing a clear partner list, offering more detailed information about data processing purposes and consequences, explicitly stating GDPR compliance, and emphasizing users' right to withdraw consent easily.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Clearly state that the policy complies with GDPR in the header or footer of the cookie policy.
   - Provide a comprehensive partner list accessible from within the cookie policy.
   - Offer more detailed information about data processing purposes and implications, particularly in terms of user privacy.
   - Emphasize users' right to withdraw consent easily, both by explicitly stating this point and providing an intuitive mechanism for changing or withdrawing consent."

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Explicit consent is given as users must accept or reject the use of cookies before accessing the site, which is presented in a clear manner with options to ""Reject All"", ""Accept All"", and ""Cookie Settings"". Users can easily withdraw consent by adjusting their settings.
  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types (Analysis Cookies, Marketing & Social Networks, Personal Offers) in the Cookie Settings. They also have granular control over these options.
  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed clearly within the Cookie Policy. The purpose of data processing (e.g., tracking visitor behavior, personalized ads) is transparent and understandable.
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant] - The policy defines consent as ""your explicit agreement to the use of cookies"" which aligns with the GDPR definition.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] - While the policy provides options for users to give or withdraw consent, it does not meet all requirements such as proving that the user has been informed of their right to withdraw consent at any time easily and in an accessible form.
  6. Critical Analysis:
     - The policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements by not clearly stating how long cookies will be stored, providing a simple way for users to access their stored personal data, or informing users about the potential consequences of rejecting some cookies (e.g., limited functionality).
  7. Final Justification:
     - The policy was classified as Partially Compliant because it provides options for users to give and withdraw consent but does not meet all requirements set by GDPR, such as providing information about data storage and access to personal data.
  8. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Clearly state the retention period for cookies in the policy.
     - Include a simple way for users to access their stored personal data within the cookie settings.
     - Provide more detailed information about the potential consequences of rejecting certain types of cookies (e.g., limited functionality)."

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented. (Partially Compliant) The policy presents the user with an option to accept all cookies, but it does not provide a mechanism to obtain explicit consent for each category of cookie. This may be considered as implicit consent, which is not in line with GDPR requirements for explicit consent.
   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism. (Compliant) The policy provides a ""Cookie Settings"" option where users can manage and change their preferences at any time, thereby allowing them to easily withdraw their consent.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. (Partially Compliant) Users are provided with an option to accept all cookies or manage preferences, but they cannot choose specific types of cookies in the presented interface. This may be considered as not offering granular control over cookies.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? (Non-Compliant) Granular control is not explicitly provided in this policy, as users are given two options: accept all cookies or manage preferences without selecting specific types of cookies.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? (Partially Compliant) The policy mentions that third-party cookies may be used for personalized advertising and remarketing, but it does not specify which third parties are involved in the data processing. More transparency is required to meet GDPR requirements.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? (Partially Compliant) The policy explains that cookies help improve the web experience and enable social media interactions, personalized messages, analytics for website performance, but it does not provide clear information about the specific purposes for each category of cookie. More detail is needed to ensure clarity and transparency.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): (Partially Compliant) The policy may be considered as offering consent options, but explicit consent is not obtained for each category of cookie. This means the definition of consent under Article 4(11) may not be fully met.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): (Non-Compliant) The policy does not present clearly distinguishable and readily available options for users to give, withdraw, or change their consent, which violates the requirements of Article 7.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. The policy falls short in various aspects, including providing explicit consent for each category of cookie, offering granular control over cookies, and ensuring transparency in data processing and third-party sharing.

7. Final Justification:
   - The classification was chosen because the policy does not fully comply with GDPR requirements regarding explicit consent, granular control over cookies, and transparency in data processing and third-party sharing. Improvements are necessary to ensure compliance.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To enhance GDPR compliance, consider updating the policy to offer explicit consent for each category of cookie, provide granular control options, clearly disclose data sharing with third parties, and specify the purpose of data processing for each category of cookie. Users should be able to give, withdraw, or change their consent easily and intuitively."

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented: Yes, the policy presents clear options for users to accept all cookies or reject non-essential ones. However, the default setting is ""Reject Non-Essential Cookies"" which could be interpreted as implicit consent for essential cookies. To fully comply with GDPR, explicit consent should be required for both essential and non-essential cookies.
   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism: Yes, users can change their preferences at any time via the ""Cookie Settings"" option, thereby withdrawing their consent.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. Users are allowed to select between accepting all cookies or rejecting non-essential ones. However, they do not have granular control over the specific type of non-essential cookies they accept. To be fully compliant with GDPR, users should be able to choose which specific types of non-essential cookies they consent to.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? No, users are only given two options and do not have the ability to select specific types of non-essential cookies that they agree to.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? Yes, the policy discloses data sharing with third parties for statistics/range measurement and marketing purposes.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? Yes, the purpose of data processing is clearly stated. However, more detailed information about the types of personal data collected and how it will be used could enhance transparency.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially Compliant + Reason] The policy partially complies with this article as it offers users the option to reject non-essential cookies. However, since essential cookies are set by default, explicit consent is not always required, which falls short of full compliance.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant + Reason] The policy partially complies with this article as users can withdraw their consent at any time. However, since the default setting allows essential cookies and since users do not have granular control over non-essential cookies, obtaining and recording user consent may still be an issue.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements: The policy does not offer sufficient transparency about the types of personal data collected, how it will be used, and who it will be shared with. Additionally, the default settings for essential cookies and lack of granular control over non-essential cookies could potentially result in non-compliance with GDPR consent requirements.

7. Final Justification:
   - Clearly explain why the classification was chosen: The policy only partially complies with GDPR due to its lack of granular control over non-essential cookies, essential cookies being set by default, and inadequate information about data collection and processing. These issues could potentially result in non-compliance with GDPR consent requirements.

   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism. - Yes, users can change their cookie preferences at any time by accessing the Cookie Settings option.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. - Users are provided with two options (Accept Cookies or Accept Only Necessary) that allow them to control the type of cookies they consent to, but not all cookie categories have granular control. For example, targeting cookies are enabled by default and require explicit consent.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? - The policy offers some level of granular control as users can choose which category of cookies they want to accept or reject, but the detailed options could be improved (e.g., providing granular control for targeting cookies).

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? - Yes, users are informed that non-essential cookies may involve data sharing with third parties (targeting cookies). However, more information could be provided about the specific third parties involved in cookie processing.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] - Compliant: The policy defines consent as freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous, which aligns with the GDPR definition. Users are provided with clear options to accept or reject cookies and can easily withdraw their consent at any time.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] - Partially Compliant: While users are informed about the processing of their personal data and have a choice in giving consent, not all cookie categories offer granular control or clear information about third parties involved.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. The policy falls short in providing complete transparency by not listing the specific third parties involved in data processing for non-essential cookies, and it does not offer granular control over all cookie types (e.g., targeting cookies are enabled by default).

7. Final Justification:
   - The policy is partially compliant with GDPR as users are provided with some choices regarding their consent to cookies and have the ability to withdraw that consent at any time. However, it could be improved in terms of transparency by disclosing specific third parties involved in data processing and providing granular control over all cookie categories.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To enhance GDPR compliance, consider listing the specific third parties involved in data processing for non-essential cookies, offering granular control over targeting cookies, and using more explicit language to explain how users' data will be used for each category of cookie."

   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy appears to comply with this article as it provides clear and distinct options that are easy to understand, allowing users to make an informed choice about their data processing preferences.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Although the policy discloses the purpose of data processing, it may fail to meet GDPR requirements if users are not sufficiently informed about the potential risks, the retention period of their personal data, or the existence of their right to object to such processing.

7. Final Justification:
   - The classification is Partially Compliant because while the policy provides clear options for consent and offers granular control over cookies, it may lack certain details required by GDPR to ensure full transparency.

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
      - Explicit consent is given as users are presented with options to accept all cookies, reject everything, or adjust their preferences for essential and advertising cookies separately. However, the ""Accept All"" option may be deemed as ambiguous since it does not clearly state that accepting all cookies includes both necessary and non-essential ones.
      - Users can easily withdraw consent by visiting ""Cookie and Advertising Settings"" and changing their selection. It is also stated that they can change their settings at any time.
  3. Granular Consent and Options:
      - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types (essential, advertising) but not granular control over individual cookies as the policy does not offer an option to choose or reject third-party cookies specifically.
      - There is no granular control over cookies offered as users can only choose to accept all, reject everything, or adjust their preferences for essential and advertising cookies in a general manner.
  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
      - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed clearly, but it could be made more transparent by explicitly stating the specific purposes of data processing (e.g., displaying personalized ads) alongside each type of data shared (e.g., browsing history from Amazon Stores).
      - The purpose of data processing is generally understandable, but a clearer explanation of how third-party providers use cookies on this service may be beneficial.
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
      - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially Compliant] While the policy does present users with options to give or withdraw consent, it could be improved by providing a clearer explanation of what constitutes consent and the implications of providing it.
      - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] The policy does offer users the ability to give or withdraw their consent, but the presentation of options may not meet GDPR requirements as the ""Accept All"" option might be perceived as ambiguous.
  6. Critical Analysis:
      - The policy could benefit from providing more detailed explanations and examples regarding data processing and third-party cookie usage to ensure transparency and understandability.
      - A more granular control over cookies, specifically allowing users to choose or reject individual third-party cookies, would enhance the policy's compliance with GDPR requirements.
  7. Final Justification: The classification was chosen as the policy partially meets the GDPR requirements for explicit consent, withdrawal mechanism, and data transparency but could benefit from improvements in these areas to ensure complete compliance.
  8. Improvement Suggestions:
      - Make sure that all options given for cookie consent clearly state their implications (e.g., ""Accept All"" includes both necessary and non-essential cookies).
      - Provide a more granular control over cookies, allowing users to choose or reject individual third-party cookies.
      - Offer clear explanations and examples regarding data processing and third-party cookie usage to ensure transparency and understandability for users."

However, it is not clear whether the purpose of data sharing with these parties is transparent and understandable, as Article 13 requires a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? The policy explains the purposes of functional, statistics, and marketing cookies, but it does not provide information about the specific purposes of data processing by third-party services using those cookies. Thus, it may fail to meet GDPR requirements for transparency.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy does not explicitly state that the consent is specific, informed, and unambiguous as required by Article 4(11). However, the granular control given to users over cookie preferences may imply a level of specificity in their consent.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy appears to meet the requirements of Article 7 by providing clear and concise information about data processing through cookies, as well as offering users the ability to give or withdraw their consent.

verbose_compliance,partially-compliant,partially_compliant_22.docx,mistral:latest," In this text, the author discusses cookies and how they are used on a website. Cookies are small files that are stored on a user's computer when they visit a website for the first time. They help to improve the user experience by tailoring content to their personal needs and interests. The text explains that there are two types of cookies: first-party cookies, which are placed on the website by the website owner or contracted service providers, and third-party cookies, which are placed on the website by other providers who may use their own cookies during a visit to the website.

   The author explains that users can manage cookie settings via features on the website, as well as through changing their browser settings. They also discuss the potential risks associated with storing and processing cookie information in countries outside of the extended European Union (EU), where data protection laws may not be equivalent to those within the EU. To mitigate this risk, they have implemented additional security measures such as contracts on the basis of EU standard contractual clauses, and complementary technical measures.

   The text also explains that users can give or revoke their consent to cookies by using the corresponding function on the website. If a user revokes their consent, the website will stop placing cookies that require consent starting from their visit to the next page, and first-party cookies will be deleted insofar as it is technically possible. However, this may result in a less optimal experience on the website.

   Finally, the author provides information on where the information collected by cookies is processed, which is primarily within the extended EU. If a user gives their consent to the category ""Analytics and Marketing Cookies,"" they also agree to the transfer and further processing of the information collected by cookies in countries outside of the extended EU."

   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially Compliant + Reason]: While the policy provides information about cookies and allows users to give or withdraw their consent, it is not entirely clear whether the given consent can be considered ""specific, informed, and freely given."" The lack of immediate revocation and refreshment mechanisms for consent may lead to some ambiguity.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant + Reason]: The policy provides a mechanism for users to give their consent to non-essential cookies, but the clarity, active role, and informed nature of the consent might still need improvements in order to fully comply with Article 7.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements: The policy could be improved by providing more specific information about how each type of cookie is used, offering a simple way for users to revoke or refresh their consent, and making it clearer that giving consent is an active choice rather than a prerequisite for using the site.

7. Final Justification:

      - The policy does not provide granular control over cookies, as users are only offered two choices (settings or accept all) without being able to select specific categories of cookies.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered?
      - No, the current settings do not offer granular control over different types of cookies, which is a requirement for GDPR compliance.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly?
      - The policy mentions that data may be shared with third countries outside the EEA without an adequate level of protection under data protection law, but it is not explicitly stated which specific third parties are involved.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable?
      - The purpose of data processing for marketing purposes is mentioned, but the details regarding personalized content and potential data transfer to non-EU countries could be made more explicit and clearer.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
      - Non-compliant: The 'accept all' option does not provide a valid, unambiguous, and specific consent for each category of cookies, as required by Article 4(11).
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
      - Non-compliant: The conditions for consent are not met since users do not have the option to give separate and specific consents for each category of cookies, as required by Article 7.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements.
      - Lack of granular control over cookie settings, lack of explicit consent for each category of cookies, and potential unclear data processing purposes could result in non-compliance with GDPR.

7. Final Justification:
   - The classification as 'partially compliant' is due to the existence of a withdrawal mechanism but the lack of granular control over cookie settings, explicit consent for each category of cookies, and clear disclosure of data processing purposes.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Provide separate, easily identifiable options for each category of cookies.
   - Offer a more prominent option to revoke consent without having to navigate away from the main site content.
   - Clearly disclose third-party sharing and data processing purposes in a transparent and understandable manner.
   - Revise the policy to ensure compliance with GDPR Article 4(11) and Article 7 requirements."

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented: Yes, users are asked to select either ""Deny All"" or ""Accept All"". However, the policy does not explicitly state that by continuing to browse the site without making a selection, the user implicitly consents to the use of essential cookies.
   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism: Users can withdraw their consent by clicking on the ""Deny All"" option within the settings. However, once the user has initially given consent, it is not clear if there's an easy way to revoke it without having to revisit the settings page.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain: Yes, users are provided with options to select or deselect different categories of cookies (Essential, Functional and Analytical, Marketing, and Social Media). However, it is not clear if the user can select specific services within each category.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? Users have granular control over cookie categories but do not seem to have the ability to control individual services within each category.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? Yes, the policy states that data may be shared with third parties for analysis, marketing purposes, personalized content playout, and social media platform interaction. However, it is not clear if all third-party service providers are listed and described.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? The policy generally describes the purpose of data processing, but some users might find it challenging to understand the specific purposes for each category and service.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially Compliant] While explicit consent is given through the ""Accept All"" button, the policy does not explicitly state that by continuing to browse the site without making a selection, the user implicitly consents to the use of essential cookies.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] Users are provided with the option to withdraw consent, but it is not clear if there's an easy way to revoke their initial consent without having to revisit the settings page. Also, granular control over individual services within each cookie category is not offered.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - The policy could improve by making it more explicit that users implicitly consent to essential cookies by continuing to browse the site. Additionally, providing a clear and easily accessible mechanism for users to revoke their initial consent would help ensure compliance with GDPR requirements. Lastly, offering granular control over individual services within each cookie category would further enhance compliance.

7. Final Justification: The classification is Partially Compliant because the policy provides explicit consent options, allows users to withdraw consent, and discloses data sharing with third parties. However, there are areas for improvement related to consent revocation mechanisms, granular control over cookies, and making the consent process more transparent.

8. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance GDPR compliance, consider adding a clear notice that users implicitly accept essential cookies by continuing to browse the site. Implement an easy-to-use mechanism for revoking consent and provide granular control over individual services within each cookie category. Additionally, ensure all third-party service providers are listed and described in the policy, with transparent and understandable purposes of data processing for each category and service."

   - The policy provides information about the use of cookies and a mechanism for users to revoke their consent, but it does not explicitly state that by continuing to browse the website, users are deemed to have given their consent in line with GDPR (Article 5(3) and Recital 32).
   - Moreover, there is no clear statement about whether cookies are set as soon as the user accesses the site or after the first interaction. This ambiguity may not meet the requirement of transparency under the GDPR.

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented: Yes, users are given the option to accept cookies by selecting specific options or choosing 'Agree to all'. However, it's not clear whether this constitutes active opt-in as required by GDPR (Article 4(11)).
     - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism: Users can withdraw their consent by changing their settings under ""Settings"" and deactivating specific tags/trackers/analytic tools. This is clear, but it's not presented as a simple and immediate action, which may not comply with GDPR (Recital 32).

  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain: Yes, users are provided options to choose specific categories of cookies under the ""Settings"" section. This is compliant with GDPR (Article 6(1)(a)).
     - Is granular control over cookies offered?: Yes, users can deactivate individual tags/trackers/analytic tools if they wish, providing a level of granularity. However, there is no clear distinction between essential and non-essential cookies, which may not meet the requirement for explicit consent under GDPR (Recital 32).

     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant - The policy provides information about the processing operations, offers a choice, and allows users to withdraw consent. However, it lacks clarity regarding default settings and the immediate nature of withdrawal mechanisms.

  6. Critical Analysis:
     - The policy does not provide a clear indication of whether cookies are set as soon as the user accesses the site or after the first interaction. This ambiguity may be a significant point of concern under GDPR, as it affects the transparency and validity of consent.
     - The withdrawal mechanism could be improved to offer a simple and immediate action for users.

  7. Final Justification:
     - The policy is partially compliant because it provides some essential information and offers a means for users to control their cookie settings, but there are areas where it falls short of meeting GDPR requirements, such as clarity around the initial consent mechanism and withdrawal options.

  8. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Make it clear that by continuing to browse the website, users are deemed to have given their consent under GDPR.
     - Ensure the consent mechanism is an active opt-in.
     - Simplify the cookie settings interface and improve the withdrawal mechanism to offer a more immediate action for users.
     - Clearly state default settings regarding essential and non-essential cookies in the policy."

     - Explicit consent is given through the ""Agree"" button, which consents to all processing for the aforementioned purposes. The ""Decline"" option allows only the use of necessary techniques. The ""Adjust"" option offers customization of consent settings.
     - Users can easily withdraw consent by modifying their preferences in the ""Adjust"" section.
  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types under the ""Adjust"" option, where they can determine the scope of consent for different purposes (e.g., Statistics, Marketing/Self-Promotion).
     - A granular level of control over cookies is offered through this customization feature.
  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed clearly in the policy. Specific third-party partners involved are mentioned (The UK Trade Desk Ltd., Virtual Minds GmbH, Trakken GmbH).
     - The purpose of data processing, such as creating personalized advertising and statistics, is transparent and understandable. However, the detail provided about each technique and data processing method within the ""Adjust"" option could be improved for better transparency.
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially Compliant] The policy does explain that consent is ""given through a clear affirmative action"", but it could provide more explicit language, such as stating that users' actions constitute their ""clear and specific"" consent.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant] The policy clearly informs users about the purposes of processing their personal data and provides a mechanism to withdraw consent at any time.
  6. Critical Analysis:
     - Although the policy offers granular control over cookies, it could be improved by providing more detailed information about each technique and data processing method within the ""Adjust"" option for better transparency and understanding.
  7. Final Justification:
     - The policy is partially compliant because it provides a mechanism for users to give and withdraw consent, offers granular control over cookies, and discloses data sharing with third parties. However, it could improve its explicit language in relation to Article 4(11) and provide more detailed information about each technique and data processing method.
  8. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Provide more explicit language regarding the ""consent definition"" (Article 4(11)) in the policy.
     - Enhance transparency by offering a detailed explanation of each technique and data processing method within the ""Adjust"" option for users to make informed decisions. This could include information about how the data is processed, why it's necessary, and how long the data will be stored."
verbose_compliance,partially-compliant,partially_compliant_30.docx,mistral:latest,"1. Classification: Partially Compliant

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented. [Compliant] The policy presents explicit consent through the user clicking 'Accept all cookies'. This action signifies that they have read, understood, and agreed to the use of cookies on the website.
   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism. [Partially Compliant] Users can change or revoke their consent in the ""Cookie Settings"", but it is not explicitly mentioned within the initial policy text that this option exists. This could lead to confusion, so a clearer explanation of the withdrawal process is needed.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. [Partially Compliant] Users can choose individual settings in the ""Cookie Settings"", but it's not immediately apparent what each category represents (Marketing, Functional, Essential). This could make it difficult for some users to understand and make informed decisions about their consent.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? [Partially Compliant] Users can select individual settings in the ""Cookie Settings"", but the level of granularity may still be insufficient for those who wish to have complete control over the specific cookies that are collected and processed.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? [Compliant] The policy mentions that data may be transferred to and processed by third parties, but it doesn't specify which third parties are involved or the purpose of this processing. This information should be made more transparent.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? [Partially Compliant] The purpose of essential cookies is explained in terms of website functionality and security, but other types of cookies (Marketing, Functional) need clearer explanations about their intended use to ensure transparency and user understanding.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially Compliant] The policy meets the requirement that consent is specific, informed, and freely given through the 'Accept all cookies' action. However, it does not clearly state whether the user has given their unambiguous consent to each individual cookie type.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] The policy satisfies the requirement that the request for consent is presented in an intelligible and easily accessible form, but it may fail to meet the condition that the user can revoke consent as easily as they gave it since this information is not prominently featured within the initial policy text.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. The policy lacks transparency in disclosing data sharing with third parties and the purpose of processing specific cookie types, which could result in a failure to provide users with clear and concise information about how their personal data will be used. Additionally, the mechanism for withdrawing consent is not easily accessible within the initial policy text.

7. Final Justification:
   - The classification was chosen as 'Partially Compliant' because while there are some elements that meet GDPR requirements, other areas require improvement in terms of transparency and user control over their personal data.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To enhance GDPR compliance, the policy should make it clearer how users can revoke or change their consent, provide detailed explanations for each type of cookie (Marketing, Functional, Essential), and disclose data sharing with third parties and the purpose of this processing more transparently."

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented: Yes, the user is explicitly informed about the use of cookies and their data processing purposes, and must click ""Accept all"" to give consent for all categories of cookies (essential, functional, and marketing).
     - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism: Users can change their cookie settings at any time by clicking on the cookie button (blue fingerprint icon) located at the bottom of the website. After making changes, they may need to restart their browser for these changes to take effect.
  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain: Yes, users can choose which categories (marketing, functional, essential) of cookies to accept or decline through the settings options provided.
     - Is granular control over cookies offered? Yes, the policy provides a reasonable level of granularity as users can choose which categories and specific services they consent to or not.
  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? Yes, the policy clearly mentions the use of Google Marketing, Microsoft Clarity, YouTube, and Usercentrics Consent Management Platform as third-party services that may process user data.
     - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? Yes, the policy provides clear information on the purposes for which cookies are used, including improving website performance, analyzing usage behavior, and enabling special functions such as playing embedded YouTube videos or using contact forms.
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant] The policy provides a valid mechanism for obtaining user consent to the use of cookies that meets the definition in Article 4(11). Consent is specific, informed, and freely given.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] While the policy provides information about the processing purposes, it does not clearly demonstrate that users have been provided with a clear and comprehensive description of what each category of cookies entails, as required by Article 7(2)(a).
  6. Critical Analysis:
     - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements: The policy fails to fully comply with Article 7(2)(a) because it does not provide a clear and comprehensive description of each category of cookies. This could potentially lead to users being unable to make an informed decision about whether or not they consent to the processing of their data.
  7. Final Justification:
     - Clearly explain why the classification was chosen: The policy is partially compliant because it does provide explicit consent, granular control over cookies, and clear disclosure of third-party data sharing. However, it falls short in terms of fully meeting the requirement for a clear and comprehensive description of each category of cookies as outlined in Article 7(2)(a).
  8. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Practical steps to enhance GDPR compliance: To bring the policy into full compliance with GDPR, it would be beneficial to provide a more detailed explanation of what each category of cookie entails (e.g., marketing cookies collect data for advertising purposes) and why their use is necessary for the website's functionality or improvement. This will help users make informed decisions about whether or not they want to consent to these cookies being used."

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented. (Compliant): The policy presents an explicit request for users to accept cookies, which is a clear indication of consent. However, the ""Accept All"" button could be more explicitly labeled as ""I agree to the storage of cookies on my device"".
     - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism. (Partially Compliant): Users can withdraw their consent by clicking on the ""Manage Consent Preferences"" or ""Reject All"" option, but it's not immediately obvious how this affects ongoing data processing. A more prominent link to withdraw consent at any time would improve compliance.
  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. (Partially Compliant): Users can choose from three options: ""Accept All"", ""Reject All"", or ""Cookies Settings (Modern)"". However, the granularity could be improved as users cannot select specific cookie categories to accept or reject.
     - Is granular control over cookies offered? (Partially Compliant): Users can choose between three broad options, but they cannot select which specific cookies they want to allow or block.
  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? (Compliant): The policy mentions that functional and targeting cookies may be set by third-party providers, and that the data might also be transferred outside the European Economic Area without an adequate level of protection. However, it could be more explicit about which specific third parties are involved.
     - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? (Partially Compliant): The policy explains that cookies help enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in marketing efforts, but it could provide more detailed explanations for each category of cookies to make the purposes more understandable.
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant]: The policy's definition of consent seems consistent with the GDPR, as it is a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which they, by statement or clear affirmative action, signify agreement to the processing of personal data.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant]: Although the policy presents a clear and affirmative action for consent, it could improve in terms of providing granular control over cookies and making the withdrawal of consent more prominent and user-friendly.
  6. Critical Analysis: The policy could benefit from offering more specific information about which third parties are involved in data processing, providing more detailed explanations for each category of cookies, and improving the mechanism for withdrawing consent.
  7. Final Justification: The classification is Partially Compliant because while the policy does present a clear request for consent, it could improve in terms of offering granular control over cookies, clearly communicating data sharing with third parties, and making the withdrawal of consent more prominent and user-friendly.
  8. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance GDPR compliance, the policy could offer more specific information about which third parties are involved in data processing, provide more detailed explanations for each category of cookies, improve the mechanism for withdrawing consent by offering a clear link to do so, and making the user's choices more granular."

   - The policy discloses the use of cookies, explains how to give and withdraw consent, and provides some transparency regarding the purposes of data processing (functionality and marketing). However, it lacks clarity in terms of third-party sharing and fails to offer granular control over cookie types.

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Explicit consent is given through a pop-up where users can choose from 'Save settings', 'Deny and continue', or 'Accept all and continue'. This mechanism is clear and easy for users to understand.
     - Users can easily withdraw consent by clicking the 'Save settings' button and then changing their preferences in the detailed settings section. However, it would be more user-friendly if an option to quickly reset or delete all cookies were available without having to go through the detailed settings each time.

  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types (Marketing, Functional, Essential), but there is no granular control over individual cookies within these categories. For example, users cannot choose to block only certain marketing cookies or analytic tools. This lack of granularity makes it difficult for users to exercise their right to give informed consent as required by GDPR.

  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed, but not in a clear or comprehensive manner. The policy mentions the use of third-party services like dotCMS Site Settings, Usercentrics Consent Management Platform, Webtrekk, Captivate Podcast, Flipsnack Player, MovingImage, Social Media wall, Sprinklr, and YouTube Video, but it does not specify which specific data is shared with these parties or the purpose of sharing.
     - The purpose of data processing is transparent in that it explains why cookies are used to activate the core functionality of the website (Essential), improve user experience (Functional), and serve relevant ads (Marketing). However, more transparency regarding third-party services would further comply with GDPR requirements.

  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy does not explicitly mention that users have the right to withdraw their consent at any time, which is required by this article. However, it does provide a mechanism for users to do so, albeit with some inconvenience. [Partially Compliant]
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): While the policy provides clear information about cookie usage and offers an easy way to give consent, it fails to offer granular control over individual cookies, which is necessary for users to make informed decisions about their data. [Non-Compliant]

  6. Critical Analysis:
     - The policy fails to provide a clear explanation of how user data is shared with third parties and the purpose of such sharing. This lack of transparency may raise concerns regarding compliance with GDPR, particularly in terms of Article 13 (Information to be provided where personal data are collected from the data subject) and Article 14 (Information to be provided where personal data have not been obtained from the data subject).
     - The policy does not offer granular control over individual cookies within each category (Marketing, Functional, Essential), which makes it difficult for users to give informed consent as required by GDPR. This may also affect the lawfulness of processing under Article 6(1)(a) (Consent of the data subject).

  7. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it offers a clear way to give and withdraw consent, although it lacks clarity in some areas such as third-party sharing and granular control over cookies. It fails to meet GDPR requirements in terms of providing comprehensive information about data sharing with third parties and offering users the ability to make informed decisions about their data by controlling individual cookies.

  8. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Clearly disclose data sharing practices with third parties, including the specific data shared and the purpose of such sharing.
     - Offer granular control over individual cookies within each category (Marketing, Functional, Essential). This will enable users to make informed decisions about their data in line with GDPR requirements.
     - Make it easier for users to withdraw consent by providing an option to quickly reset or delete all cookies without having to go through the detailed settings each time."

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented. The cookie policy presents an explicit option for users to give their consent, as they can either accept all cookies or deny all cookies. However, it does not provide a granular option to select specific types of cookies.
   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism. Users can easily revoke their consent by clicking the ""Individual Settings"" option and adjusting their settings accordingly. They can also deny all cookies initially as an alternative method to withdraw consent.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. Users are not explicitly given the option to select specific cookie types in the initial notification. However, they can do so by clicking the ""Individual Settings"" link and adjusting their preferences there.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? While users can control individual cookie types through the ""Individual Settings"" mechanism, this control is not provided in an easily understandable or transparent manner for all users.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? The policy mentions several third-party cookies like DoubleClick Floodlight, Google Ads, LinkedIn, and others. However, it does not provide clear and understandable descriptions of the purpose of this data sharing or how the data will be used by these third parties.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? The policy only vaguely mentions improvements in user experience, optimization of marketing campaigns, personalized content, etc., but it does not provide a clear and concise description of the specific purposes for which data will be processed.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Non-Compliant] The policy does not explicitly present consent in a manner that is ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous"" as required by the GDPR definition of consent. While users can give or withdraw their consent, they are not provided with an easily understandable option to select specific types of cookies.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Non-Compliant] The policy does not meet all conditions for valid consent as specified in Article 7. Users are not explicitly provided with information about the identity of the data controller, their rights as data subjects, or the potential consequences of refusing to provide consent.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. The policy lacks clarity in explaining the purposes for data processing, fails to provide a granular option for users to select specific cookie types, and does not fully comply with the transparency requirements of the GDPR. Additionally, the consent mechanism could be improved to ensure that it meets the GDPR's definition of free, specific, informed, and unambiguous consent.

7. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant as it offers users the option to give or withdraw their consent, but it fails in other key aspects such as providing transparency about data processing purposes and offering granular control over cookies.

8. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance GDPR compliance, the following improvements can be made:
   - Provide a more transparent and understandable description of the purposes for which data will be processed.
   - Offer users a granular option to select specific types of cookies in the initial notification rather than directing them to an ""Individual Settings"" page.
   - Include information about the identity of the data controller, users' rights as data subjects, and the potential consequences of refusing to provide consent in the cookie policy or at least make this information easily accessible for users."

   - The policy provides some information about the use of cookies and offers users a choice to accept or decline them, which partially complies with GDPR requirements. However, it lacks specific details required for full compliance, such as detailed information on the purpose of data processing and data sharing with third parties.

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented: The policy presents an option to accept or decline cookies when users visit the website, which constitutes explicit consent. However, the ""Yes"" option implies consent for all types of cookies, which might not be considered granular enough under GDPR requirements.
   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism: Users can withdraw their consent by adjusting their cookie settings in the provided link. This mechanism is easy to use and complies with GDPR requirements.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain: The policy provides options for ""Required cookies,"" ""Functional Cookies,"" and ""Services from other companies (autonomous third-party providers)"" along with ""Marketing Cookies."" However, it does not offer granular control over each type of cookie, as users can only choose to allow all or manage their consent preferences. This partially complies with GDPR requirements, which encourage granular control over data processing activities.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? The policy offers a choice between ""Allow All"" and ""Manage Consent Preferences,"" but it does not provide granular control over individual cookies or specific settings for each type of cookie. This partially complies with GDPR requirements, as users are able to manage their preferences, but the options are not detailed enough.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? The policy mentions ""Services from other companies (autonomous third-party providers)"" in the cookie settings, but it does not explicitly state what data is shared or why. This non-compliance with GDPR requirements can lead to users being uninformed about their personal data usage.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? The policy does not provide a clear explanation of the purpose of data processing beyond improving site navigation, analyzing site usage, and supporting marketing efforts. This non-compliance with GDPR requirements can lead to users being uninformed about how their personal data is used.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy presents a mechanism for obtaining user consent, but it does not clearly demonstrate that the consent is ""specific, informed and unambiguous."" As users are only given the option to accept or decline all cookies without detailed explanations of each type, this partially complies with Article 4(11).
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy provides an option for users to give their consent, but it does not comply with Article 7 as the information provided about data processing and third-party sharing is not specific, transparent, or easily accessible. Additionally, the consent obtained is not freely given as users might not fully understand the implications of accepting all cookies.

6. Critical Analysis: The policy fails to meet GDPR requirements in several key areas, such as providing a clear explanation of data processing purposes and third-party sharing practices, offering granular control over cookie preferences, and ensuring that consent is freely given and informed. These deficiencies may result in users being uninformed about how their personal data is used and potentially lacking the ability to make meaningful choices regarding the use of their data.

7. Final Justification: The policy was classified as Partially Compliant due to its lack of specificity in explaining data processing purposes, third-party sharing practices, and offering granular control over cookie preferences. Additionally, it does not meet GDPR requirements for obtaining freely given and informed consent.

8. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance GDPR compliance, the following improvements can be made:
   - Provide a detailed explanation of the purpose of data processing for each type of cookie used on the website.
   - Offer granular control over individual cookies or specific settings for each type of cookie to give users more choice and control over their personal data usage.

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented: The policy presents a clear message about the use of cookies and asks for user's consent, which can be considered as an explicit form of consent. However, the consent mechanism itself is not directly visible on the page without clicking ""Privacy Settings.""
     - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism: Users can easily withdraw their consent by either denying cookie usage or selecting specific cookies to be disabled. The mechanism is available under the ""Privacy Settings"" section. However, it lacks a simple and easy way to revoke previously given consent at any time.

  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain: Users can select or deselect specific cookie types, which indicates that they have some degree of control over their data usage.
     - Is granular control over cookies offered?: The policy offers a level of granularity in terms of controlling the types of cookies used; users can choose between ""Essential"" and ""Statistics"" categories. However, it does not seem to provide an option for adjusting the individual settings within each category, which could be improved for greater control.

  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? The policy explains that the use of ""Statistics"" cookies helps website owners to understand how visitors interact with websites by collecting and reporting information anonymously, which may imply third-party sharing. However, there is no mention of specific third-parties involved or their locations, which is a key aspect for transparency.
     - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? The policy provides some level of transparency regarding the purpose of data processing by explaining that cookies are used to secure basic website functions and improve user experience on the site. However, it could be more detailed and explicit about the specific purposes, especially for ""Statistics"" cookies.

  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially Compliant + Reason] The policy meets the requirement of seeking user's consent for the use of cookies, but it fails to provide a clear and affirmative action that is easily accessible.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant + Reason] The policy offers clear and specific information about the processing operations, which aligns with the requirement for transparent and easily understandable information.

  6. Critical Analysis: The policy lacks some key aspects of GDPR compliance such as providing a simple and easily accessible way to revoke consent, explicit mention of any third-party cookies used, and more detailed explanations about the purpose of data processing.

  7. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it seeks user's consent for cookie usage and offers some level of granularity in controlling cookies. However, it fails to meet GDPR requirements regarding transparency, third-party sharing, and revoking previously given consent easily.

  8. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance GDPR compliance, the policy should clearly disclose any third-party cookies used, provide a simple and easily accessible mechanism for users to revoke their consent at any time, offer more detailed explanations about the purpose of data processing, and improve the granularity by allowing users to adjust individual settings within each category."

   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? (Compliant): The purpose of using cookies for personalized advertising and website functionality is clear.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Non-Compliant]: Since users are not given the option to select specific cookie types, it can be argued that the consent does not meet the requirements of ""freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous"" as defined in Article 4(11).
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant]: While users are presented with a choice to accept or reject cookies, they do not have granular control over optional cookie types, which partially violates the requirement that consent should be given ""for one or more specific purposes"".

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. The policy does not provide a clear method for users to give granular consent for optional cookies, and it is unclear whether third-party data sharing will occur.

7. Final Justification:
   - The classification is Partially Compliant because the policy provides an option to accept or reject cookies, but it lacks granular control over optional cookie types.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To enhance GDPR compliance, Symrise should allow users to choose specific cookie types and provide more explicit disclosure of third-party data sharing practices.

     - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? Yes, the purpose is transparent as it is stated that cookies are used for analysis, performance, marketing, and individual marketing.

  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant] The policy requests user's consent to the processing of personal data using cookies, which aligns with the definition provided in Article 4(11).
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] While users are informed about their right to withdraw consent, the policy does not provide a means to obtain and demonstrate user's explicit, informed, and freely given consent before cookies are set.

  6. Critical Analysis: The policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements due to the lack of granular control over cookies and the insufficient disclosure of third-party involvement in data processing.

  7. Final Justification: The classification was chosen based on the observation that while the policy provides basic information about cookies, it does not offer users the level of transparency and control required by GDPR.

  8. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance GDPR compliance, the following steps can be taken:
     - Offer granular control over specific cookie types to users
     - Clearly identify and disclose third-party involvement in data processing
     - Provide a means for obtaining user's explicit consent before cookies are set
     - Make the policy more easily accessible, understandable, and user-friendly."

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented: The policy presents explicit consent through the user's interaction with the cookie banner, offering three options: ""Set preferences,"" ""Only essential,"" and ""Accept all."" The implications of each option are clearly stated.
     - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism: Users can easily manage their preferences by clicking on the ""Set preferences"" button, which leads to a page where they can deactivate various tags/trackers/analytic tools used on the website. They can adjust their preferences at any time.
  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain: Users are given granular control over certain categories of cookies such as Services, Web Performance and Analytics, and Marketing. The policy provides detailed explanations for each category. However, it does not appear that users can select specific individual cookies within those categories.

  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant] The policy defines consent as a freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which they signify agreement to the processing of their personal data. It is presented through user interaction with the cookie banner.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] While the policy provides information about what data is collected and how it is used, it does not appear that the user's consent is separate from the website's functionalities. Therefore, there could be an argument that the user's continued use of the site implies consent, which might not meet the strict requirements of Article 7(4).
  6. Critical Analysis:
     - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements: The policy does not provide a clear way for users to withdraw their consent without interacting with the website. This could potentially violate Article 7(3), which states that the data subject should be able to withdraw their consent at any time and as easily as they gave it.
  7. Final Justification: The policy is partially compliant because it provides some level of transparency regarding cookie usage, offers granular control over certain categories of cookies, and obtains explicit user consent through the cookie banner. However, it does not fully meet GDPR requirements due to limitations in the withdrawal mechanism for consent.
  8. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance GDPR compliance, the policy could provide a clear way for users to withdraw their consent without interacting with the website (e.g., through an email or online form). Additionally, considering that continued use of the site might not meet strict requirements for consent under Article 7(4), it would be advisable to offer an explicit ""Withdraw Consent"" option within the cookie banner or on a dedicated webpage."

   - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types, as they can adjust their consent settings according to various purposes and functions. This is granular control over cookies offered.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed clearly in the policy. However, the purpose of data processing may not always be transparent and understandable, as it uses technical terms that might not be easily understood by all users.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The definition provided in the policy seems to align with Article 4(11), which states consent is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which they, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signify agreement to the processing of personal data relating to them.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy does provide information about what data is being processed, the purpose of processing, and offers a way to withdraw consent. However, it may not meet the requirement of being ""easily accessible, explicitly given and in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language"" due to some technical terms used throughout the policy.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - The policy does provide a choice for users to select specific cookie types, which is a strong point. However, it may fail to meet GDPR requirements in providing transparent and easily understandable information about data processing.

7. Final Justification:
   - The classification is Partially Compliant because the policy offers granular control over cookies and provides a way to withdraw consent, but it could be more transparent and easy for users to understand the purpose of data processing.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Simplify the language used in the policy to make it easier for users to understand what they are agreeing to. Offer an option to automatically deny non-essential cookies, so that users don't have to manually select them.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant] The policy explicitly states that consent is given by users for the processing of their personal data, which aligns with the GDPR definition of consent.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] While users are provided with a clear choice to accept or refuse processing, they may not be aware of their right to withdraw consent without encountering difficulties. Additionally, it's not explicitly mentioned that the user should actively grant consent as a positive action rather than passively allowing data processing through inactivity.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. Although the policy offers granular control over cookies and discloses third-party vendors, it could provide a more simplified explanation of data processing purposes. The policy does not explicitly mention that users should actively grant consent as a positive action rather than passively allowing data processing through inactivity, which may potentially fail to meet GDPR requirements.

7. Final Justification:
   - The classification is Partially Compliant because the policy offers granular control over cookies and discloses third-party vendors but could improve in terms of providing a more simplified explanation of data processing purposes and actively requiring user consent as a positive action.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To enhance GDPR compliance, consider providing a more simplified explanation of data processing purposes. Also, require users to actively grant consent by taking a positive action rather than passively allowing data processing through inactivity. Additionally, ensure that the withdrawal of consent is easily accessible and explained clearly within the policy."

     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason]
       - Partially Compliant: Users are given the opportunity to give consent and withdraw it, but the initial request for consent does not meet the strict requirements of GDPR.
  6. Critical Analysis:
     - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements.
       - The initial request for consent in the cookie banner does not comply with GDPR's requirements, as it should be a standalone banner and should explicitly ask for user agreement. Additionally, users may not realize that clicking ""Accept All"" implies consent for data processing outside the European Union.
  7. Final Justification:
     - The classification is Partially Compliant because while the policy offers granular control over cookies and explains the purposes of each cookie category, it does not meet all GDPR requirements regarding user consent.
  8. Improvement Suggestions:
     - To improve compliance with GDPR, the following steps can be taken:
       - Replace the current cookie banner with a standalone banner that explicitly asks for user agreement and clearly explains each category of cookies.
       - Make it clearer to users that by clicking ""Accept All,"" they are consenting not only to cookies but also to data processing outside the European Union.

   - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed clearly in the policy by mentioning the use of marketing cookies for displaying advertisements on third-party websites.
   - The purpose of data processing is generally transparent, as it is explained that performance cookies are used to improve user experience and marketing cookies for targeted advertising. However, the policy could be more specific about the exact purposes and potential recipients of the data.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy complies with this article as it correctly explains that user consent is not required for strictly necessary cookies, and provides an option to block them if desired.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant, as the policy provides clear information about the use of cookies and requires explicit consent from users.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - The policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements by not providing enough detail about the specific purposes and recipients of data processed via marketing and performance cookies. This lack of specificity could make it difficult for users to fully understand what they are consenting to.

7. Final Justification:
   - The classification is Partially Compliant as while the policy provides explicit consent and a method to withdraw that consent, it could benefit from more detailed information about the purposes and recipients of data processed via marketing and performance cookies.

     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Non-Compliant + Reason]: The policy does not offer users a free choice between accepting or rejecting cookies, as it provides only three predefined options. This may not align with the GDPR requirement that consent must be freely given and may involve penalties upon withdrawal of consent (Article 7(4)).

  6. Critical Analysis:
     - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. The policy lacks transparency regarding specific third-party data sharing, fails to provide granular control over individual cookies, and does not offer a clear and free choice in accepting or rejecting all cookies. It also does not specify whether consent is given specifically, informed, and unambiguously.

  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed, as the policy informs users about the use of various services from companies like Google, Facebook, Adform, etc.
     - The purpose of data processing is transparent, as it explains that cookies are used for functionalities, performance, and marketing purposes.
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy seems to comply with this article as it presents clear and specific options for users to give their consent or refuse certain types of cookies.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): Compliant, as the policy ensures that users are provided with transparent information regarding the use of cookies, and they have the option to withdraw their consent at any time.
  6. Critical Analysis: The policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements in terms of providing granular control over individual services within each cookie category, making it difficult for users to understand exactly which third-party services they are consenting to.
  7. Final Justification: The classification is 'Partially Compliant' because the policy provides clear options for users to give and withdraw their consent, but there is a lack of granular control over individual services within each cookie category.
  8. Improvement Suggestions: To enhance GDPR compliance, it would be beneficial to provide more detailed information about the individual third-party services included in each category (Performance, Marketing, etc.) and offer users the ability to customize their consent for these services. This will help ensure that users have a clear understanding of what they are agreeing to when giving their consent."

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented. The policy presents a choice between 'I agree' and 'Deny', but it does not provide specific information about the types of cookies being used or their purposes, which may not meet the requirements for explicit consent as per GDPR.
   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism. Users can modify settings or withdraw consent through the link ""Cookie settings"" in the footer of the website, but the policy does not clearly specify how this affects the processing of personal data.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. The policy provides a list of third-party service providers under the 'Categories' section, but it does not allow users to choose or deactivate specific cookies within each category.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? No, the policy does not offer granular control over the individual cookies within each category.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? The policy mentions the use of third-party services but does not provide clear information about the nature of the data being shared or why it is necessary for the functioning of the website.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? The purpose of data processing (to provide a personalized experience, serve relevant ads, and analyze online behavior) is mentioned, but the specifics of how this is done are not fully explained, which may not meet the transparency requirements under GDPR.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially Compliant + Reason] The policy does mention the need for consent but does not provide a clear and affirmative action from the user, which may not meet the specific requirements of Article 4(11).
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Non-Compliant + Reason] The policy does not offer granular control over cookies, and it does not present information in an easily accessible form, which may not comply with the conditions for consent as outlined in Article 7.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. The policy lacks clarity in presenting specific information about the types of cookies being used and their purposes, does not offer granular control over individual cookies, and does not provide a clear mechanism for users to withdraw consent with regards to personal data processing.

7. Final Justification:
   - The classification is Partially Compliant because while the policy does mention the need for consent and provides an option to accept or deny cookies, it does not meet all the requirements for explicit consent under GDPR due to a lack of clarity in presenting specific information about cookies and their purposes, as well as not offering granular control over individual cookies.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To enhance GDPR compliance, the policy should provide more detailed information about the types of cookies being used, their purposes, and why they are necessary for the functioning of the website. It should also offer granular control over individual cookies within each category and a clear mechanism for users to withdraw consent. The policy could also be simplified to make it easier for users to understand."

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented: The policy presents a choice between three options - ""Accept Only Essentials,"" ""Save and Close,"" and ""Accept All."" However, users are not explicitly asked to accept cookies in an unambiguous manner, which may fall short of GDPR's requirement for explicit consent.
   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism: The policy offers a mechanism to withdraw consent by either accepting only essential cookies or refusing all cookies (save and close). However, it lacks a simple and easy-to-find option to revoke previously given consent.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. The policy allows users to choose between three groups of cookies - ""Essential,"" ""Analytics & Performance,"" and ""External content."" While this is granular in terms of broad categories, it does not offer the level of detail required by GDPR for individual cookies.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? The policy does not appear to provide users with granular control over each individual cookie.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? While the policy mentions using external content, it fails to specify which third parties are involved or the nature of the data shared.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? The purpose of data processing is not explicitly stated in the policy.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Non-Compliant] The policy does not seem to provide unambiguous, freely given, specific, informed and explicit consent as required by GDPR for data processing through cookies.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] While the policy offers a choice, it lacks detailed information about each cookie, which is necessary for informed consent.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements: The policy does not provide sufficient detail on specific cookies, their purposes, and third-party involvement, making it difficult for users to give informed consent. Additionally, the method of revoking consent is not user-friendly or easily accessible.

7. Final Justification:
   - Clearly explain why the classification was chosen: The policy does not offer explicit, specific, freely given, and informed consent as required by GDPR. This lack of transparency and granularity in the cookie settings puts it partially compliant with GDPR requirements.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Practical steps to enhance GDPR compliance: To improve compliance, the policy should offer a clear choice for each individual cookie, specify the purpose of data processing, disclose any third-party involvement, and provide an easy-to-find mechanism to revoke consent at any time. It is also recommended to make the presentation of the consent mechanism more unambiguous and user-friendly."

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented. (Compliant) The policy presents an explicit statement asking users to agree to the setting of cookies, and their use, as well as the subsequent processing of the collected data for personalized advertising and marketing purposes.
   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism. (Partially Compliant) Users can adjust their cookie settings at any time according to their wishes, which indicates a withdrawal mechanism. However, it's not immediately clear how to do this from the initial consent banner, potentially making it less user-friendly.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. (Partially Compliant) The policy provides options for users to choose between ""Only necessary cookies"" or ""Accept all cookies"". However, it's not clear if ""all cookies"" includes all categories of cookies (strictly necessary, performance, functional, marketing, and targeting).
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? (Partially Compliant) Users can manage their consent preferences for different cookie types in the Cookie Settings section. But there's no explicit statement about which specific cookies are included in each category.

   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? (Compliant) The policy explains the primary purposes of cookie usage: website usage analysis, optimizing marketing activities, and personalized advertising.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially Compliant] Consent is obtained based on an informed indication of the data subject's wishes (either by a button or user action to hide the banner), but it may not be as easy to withdraw consent as required under GDPR.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] The policy provides a means for users to give and withdraw consent, but it does not explicitly state that consent is specific, informed, and unambiguous. Additionally, granularity in consent may be questionable due to the lack of clear descriptions of what each cookie category includes.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. The policy could improve by providing a more user-friendly method for users to withdraw consent, offering a granular and transparent approach to consent, and specifying the exact cookies included in each category to enable more informed decisions.

7. Final Justification:
   - The policy is partially compliant with GDPR as it offers an opportunity for users to give and withdraw their consent. However, improvements are needed regarding the user-friendliness of withdrawal mechanisms, granularity, transparency, and specificity in the description of cookie categories.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Revise the consent banner to make it easier for users to understand how to withdraw their consent.
   - Offer a more transparent and granular approach to consents by describing each cookie category accurately, including specific cookies within those categories, and providing an option to select individual cookies rather than just broad categories.
   - Enhance the user-friendliness of the Cookie Settings section by offering clear explanations for each cookie type and making it easier for users to locate and adjust their preferences."

   - Users can easily withdraw their consent by accessing the Privacy Settings at the bottom of the website and changing their settings. This mechanism is clear and accessible.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types by using the ""More options"" feature, which leads them to the Privacy Settings where they can choose among various processing purposes and providers. However, the granularity of this control is not immediately apparent on the cookie banner.
   - The policy does offer granular control over cookies through the customization settings in the Privacy Settings, but it could be improved by presenting these options more clearly on the initial cookie banner.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Disclosure of data sharing with third parties is mentioned, but it is not clear or understandable to the average user. The specific purposes of data processing are also not transparent.
   - The purpose of data processing is partially disclosed in the Privacy Settings, but it is not immediately apparent on the cookie banner or before consent is given.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Non-Compliant] The policy does not provide a clear, affirmative action or statement that the data subject has given their explicit consent for each specific purpose and third party.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] While users are given an opportunity to withdraw their consent, the initial presentation of the purposes of data processing and third-party sharing is not transparent enough before consent is given.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - The policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements by not providing a clear and understandable explanation of the purposes of data processing and third-party sharing before seeking user consent. This lack of transparency could result in invalid consent.

7. Final Justification:
   - The classification is Partially Compliant because while users can withdraw their consent, the initial presentation of the purposes of data processing and third-party sharing does not comply with GDPR requirements for explicit and transparent consent.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Clearly present the purposes of data processing and third-party sharing on the initial cookie banner before seeking user consent.
   - Provide a more straightforward and understandable explanation of these purposes within the policy text itself.
   - Offer a granular, easily accessible option for users to control their cookie preferences at the initial cookie banner level."

   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] Although users are presented with clear and concise information about the types of cookies used, the consent process does not meet all GDPR requirements as it lacks transparency regarding specific third-party recipients of personal data.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements: The policy fails to provide a comprehensive list of third parties with whom personal data may be shared, and it does not offer granular control over cookies beyond the option to accept or decline specific categories.

7. Final Justification:
   - Clearly explain why the classification was chosen: Although the policy provides some level of transparency regarding the use of cookies, it does not fully comply with GDPR requirements due to the lack of a complete list of third parties and granular control over cookie preferences.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Practical steps to enhance GDPR compliance: To improve GDPR compliance, the policy should offer a more detailed list of third-party recipients of personal data, as well as provide granular control over individual cookie preferences, allowing users to customize their settings beyond just accepting or declining specific categories. The policy could also be revised to clarify the specific purposes for collecting and processing personal data in a manner that is transparent and easy to understand."

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Is explicit consent given? Explain how it is presented. (Compliant): Yes, the user is explicitly informed about the use of cookies and presented with options to accept or decline them.
   - Can users easily withdraw consent? Describe the mechanism. (Partially Compliant): Users can revoke their consent by changing their selection under ""Cookie Settings"" at the bottom of the page. However, it's not immediately clear that this option exists for all cookies; users may need to click on ""More Information"" first to find the link to ""Cookie Settings.""

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Are users given a choice to select specific cookie types? Explain. (Partially Compliant): Users are given three options, but it's not immediately clear how their selection affects individual cookie types. For example, choosing ""Accept Everything"" may include cookies for categories that the user might prefer to decline.
   - Is granular control over cookies offered? (Partially Compliant): Granular control is somewhat offered as users can choose between accepting all cookies or only required cookies. However, it's not clear how much control they have over individual cookie types within those broader categories.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Is data sharing with third parties disclosed clearly? (Compliant): Yes, the policy discloses that data may be shared with third parties for various purposes, including external services, statistics, and marketing.
   - Is the purpose of data processing transparent and understandable? (Partially Compliant): The purpose of data processing is generally understandable, but it would be more user-friendly if each category of cookies was clearly labeled with its specific purpose.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] (Partially Compliant): The policy provides information about the processing of personal data, but it could be more explicit in explaining that consent is ""specific, informed and unambiguous.""
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant/Non-Compliant + Reason] (Partially Compliant): The policy meets some requirements for transparency, but it could improve by providing clear and concise information about the purpose of processing, the identity of the controller, and the duration of the consent.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - Identify any areas where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements. In addition to the points mentioned above, the policy does not make it easy for users to understand how their choices affect individual cookie types, which may lead to unintentional or ambiguous consent.

7. Final Justification:
   - The classification is Partially Compliant because while the policy provides some necessary information about cookies and user choices, it could improve in terms of transparency, granularity, and clarity regarding the GDPR's specific requirements.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Make it easier for users to understand how their choices affect individual cookie types within broader categories (e.g., required, external services, statistics, marketing).
   - Clearly label each category of cookies with its specific purpose.
   - Provide more concise and explicit information about the GDPR's requirements for consent, including the purpose of processing, the identity of the controller, and the duration of the consent."

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Explicit consent is given but not clearly defined under GDPR standards, as the policy does not explicitly state that the user's action (clicking ""Activate"") constitutes consent. However, it is presented in an easily accessible location.
     - Users can withdraw their consent by changing their settings or deleting cookies from their browser. The 'Change Settings' option offers a mechanism for users to adjust their preferences at any time, although this may require technical knowledge.
  3. Granular Consent and Options:
     - Users are not given a choice to select specific cookie types, but they can opt out of certain categories (Essential Technologies, Here Maps, Font Files, Web Analysis Tool, YouTube, Google Ads Conversion, Tag Commander, Form Protection, Favorite Market Feature, Marketing & Advertising) by adjusting their settings. Granular control over cookies is not offered.
  4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
     - Data sharing with third parties such as Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest, AT Internet, Tag Commander, Google, and others is disclosed but the purpose of data processing might not be clear to users due to technical language and lack of specificity.
  5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
     - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): The policy is partially compliant as it does not explicitly state that consent is ""specific, informed and unambiguous"". Although the user's action indicates consent, there is no clear indication of specificity or whether it is freely given.
     - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): The policy is partially compliant since it fails to meet some requirements: users are not given a choice to select specific cookie types (granular consent), and the language used might not be easily understandable by all users (transparency requirement).
  6. Critical Analysis:
     - The policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements due to lack of granularity in consent options, unclear data processing purposes, and the potentially vague definition of consent given.
  7. Final Justification:
     - The classification is ""Partially Compliant"" because while the policy provides some elements required by the GDPR, such as informing users about cookies and offering an option to change settings, it falls short in other areas like providing granular control over cookies, ensuring specificity of consent, and using understandable language for transparency purposes.
  8. Improvement Suggestions:
     - Offer a more transparent explanation of what each cookie category is used for (transparency).
     - Provide users with the ability to select specific cookie types they want to accept (granular consent).
     - Ensure that the language and presentation of the policy are easily understood by all users (accessibility).

2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
   - Explicit consent is given through clicking ""OK"" button, which explains the purpose of using cookies. However, it is not as easily discernible that users are providing consent. A clear statement explaining that by continuing to use the site, the user agrees to the cookie policy would further strengthen compliance.
   - Users can withdraw their consent by visiting the Privacy Information section and sending an email to the support team. While this mechanism exists, it is not as straightforward or easily accessible as it should be to meet GDPR standards.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types (Necessary, Preference, Statistics, Marketing) but there's no granular control over cookies within each category (e.g., blocking individual marketing cookies).
   - There is no granular control offered to users for the individual cookies within each category, only an option to accept all or reject them all.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed clearly in the policy, but it's not explicitly mentioned whether third-party advertising partners can combine data collected through this site with other data they have about the user.
   - The purpose of data processing is somewhat transparent as it explains why cookies are used, but the details provided may be too general and lack specificity for each cookie category.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially Compliant] The policy uses a clear and affirmative action to obtain consent, but it does not explicitly state that users have the right to withdraw their consent easily at any time.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Compliant] The information is presented in an intelligible and easily accessible form, and the policy explains the purpose of the processing. However, the ease with which users can withdraw their consent needs improvement to meet GDPR standards.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - The policy does not clearly state that users have the right to withdraw their consent easily at any time, as required by Article 7(3) of the GDPR. This could potentially lead to non-compliance issues.
   - There's no granular control over cookies within each category, which may not meet the requirements for giving individuals appropriate control over their personal data, as outlined in GDPR Article 6(1)(a).

7. Final Justification:
   - The policy is partially compliant with GDPR because it provides a choice to users regarding cookie types and explains the purpose of processing, but there are areas where it can improve, such as making it easier for users to withdraw their consent and offering more granular control over cookies.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - Clearly state that users have the right to withdraw their consent easily at any time in the cookie policy.
   - Implement a mechanism for users to select specific marketing or third-party cookies they want to block or allow, rather than only offering an all-or-nothing option.
   - Provide more specific information about data processing purposes within each category of cookies and how third parties may use the data collected on this site."

  2. Consent and Withdrawal Mechanism:
     - Explicit consent is given by users who actively choose to allow cookies when they visit the website. This is presented through three options (Allow All, Only Necessary Allow, More Options).
     - Users can easily withdraw consent as it is explained that they can change their selection at any time via the Privacy Settings at the bottom of the page. However, the withdrawal mechanism could be improved by providing a more visible and straightforward way to revoke consent, such as an opt-out button on each page.

3. Granular Consent and Options:
   - Users are given a choice to select specific cookie types through the ""More Options"" feature.
   - Granular control over cookies is offered by allowing users to customize their preferences in the Privacy Settings section. However, this may not be sufficient as users might not understand the implications of each option, and some cookies (e.g., necessary cookies) cannot be deactivated.

4. Data Transparency and Third-Party Sharing:
   - Data sharing with third parties is disclosed by listing the processing purposes and providers for each type of cookie. However, it could be improved by providing more concise explanations that are easier to understand for non-technical users.
   - The purpose of data processing is somewhat transparent as it is explained alongside each processing purpose and provider; however, there is room for improvement in making the information more accessible and user-friendly.

5. Compliance with Legal Articles:
   - Article 4(11) (Consent Definition): [Partially Compliant] The policy meets some aspects of this article as it presents users with clear, specific options to consent or withdraw their consent. However, it could be improved by ensuring that the language used is straightforward and easy for non-technical users to understand.
   - Article 7 (Conditions for Consent): [Partially Compliant] The policy partially meets this article as users are presented with clear options to give or withdraw their consent. However, it could be improved by ensuring that the request for consent is not bundled with other terms and conditions, making the process more transparent and user-friendly.

6. Critical Analysis:
   - One area where the policy may fail to meet GDPR requirements is in providing a clear and concise explanation of the purpose of data processing. Additionally, the fact that necessary cookies cannot be deactivated could potentially violate users' rights under the GDPR.

7. Final Justification:
   - The classification was chosen as the policy partially meets GDPR requirements by offering options for consent and withdrawal but could benefit from improvements in transparency, user-friendliness, and granular control over cookies.

8. Improvement Suggestions:
   - To enhance GDPR compliance, the following steps could be taken:
     - Simplify explanations of data processing purposes and provide more concise and accessible language.
     - Make it easier for users to withdraw their consent, such as by offering a visible opt-out button on each page.
     - Allow granular control over cookies without restricting necessary cookies. This could be achieved through the use of better explanations and guidance to help users make informed decisions."
